As the Latin ''[[Hispania]]'' was considered to include the entire [[Iberian peninsula]], he is traditionally and usually identified with the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] scholar and ecclesiastic Peter Juliani, who was elected [[Pope John XXI]] in 1276.<ref>Michael Haren, ''Medieval Thought'' (1985), p.148.</ref><ref>For a more recent defense of the identity between Petrus Hispanus and Pope John XXI, see the preface of W.

Peter of Spain supported an investigation of teaching at the University of Paris which resulted in the [[bishop of Paris|Parisian bishop]]'s [[Condemnation of 1277]], which denounced Aristotelian propositions which conflicted with [[dogma|church doctrine]].<ref>Principe, Lawrence M.
