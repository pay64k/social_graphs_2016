Before that, he taught at Hobart and William Smith Colleges in Geneva, NY, while finishing his Ph.D. at Syracuse University in 1991.\nIn ethics, Norcross defends a version of act utilitarianism known as scalar utilitarianism, which is the theory that there are no right or wrong actions, only better or worse actions ranked along a continuum from the action (or actions) that contributes most to overall utility to the action (or actions) that contributes the least.\n\n\n== Selected works ==\n(2006) 'Scalar Act-Utilitarianism'.
