He is an Honorary Fellow in Philosophy at the University of Melbourne.\n\n\n== Work ==\nIn 2013 Young won the Australasian Association of Philosophy's media prize for his public writing and broadcasting.\nYoung is the author of Distraction, an eclectic popular history of Western philosophy, focusing on themes such as attention to life and distraction from it, work, freedom and necessity. The Australian called it lacking in precision, saying its \"central proposition -- that new information technologies distract us from our common existential challenge -- is never thoroughly probed\" while London's Financial Times called it \"lucid and optimistic\".\nPhilosophy in the Garden, published in Australia in December 2012, was described by The Australian as \"fluent and stylish and never marred by cliches or cliched thinking\". It was published in the UK in April 2014 by Rider, an imprint of Random House, under the title Voltaire's Vine and Other Philosophies: How Gardens Inspired Great Writers.\nYoung's columns, reviews and features have been published in The Age, The Sydney Morning Herald, The Australian, Herald-Sun, BBC and ABC. He has written poetry and fiction for Overland and Meanjin magazines.\nYoung regularly comments on radio, and has appeared on Channel 7 'Sunrise' and ABC TV. He was a regular panellist on ABC Radio National's 'Life Matters', a monthly guest on \"Mornings\" with Alan Brough on ABC 774, and was 'philosopher-in-residence' on \"Afternoons\" with James Valentine on ABC Sydney 702, and \"sports philosopher\" with Francis Leach on SEN 1116.\n\n\n== Selected works ==\nA full list of Young's published works and media appearances can be found at his website.\n\n\n=== Books ===\nPhilosophy in the Garden.
