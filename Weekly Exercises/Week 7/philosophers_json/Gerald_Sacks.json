His most important contributions have been in recursion theory. Named after him is Sacks forcing, a forcing notion based on perfect sets and the Sacks Density Theorem, which asserts that the partial order of the recursively enumerable Turing degrees is dense.\nSacks earned his Ph.D. in 1961 from Cornell University under the direction of J. Barkley Rosser, with a dissertation entitled On Suborderings of Degrees of Recursive Insolvability. Among his notable students are Lenore Blum, Harvey Friedman, Sy Friedman, Leo Harrington, Richard Shore, Steve Simpson and Theodore Slaman.\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\nDegrees of unsolvability, Princeton University Press 1963, 1966\nSaturated Model Theory, Benjamin 1972; 2nd edition, World Scientific 2010\nHigher Recursion theory, Springer 1990\nSelected Logic Papers, World Scientific 1999\nMathematical Logic in the 20th Century, World Scientific 2003\n\n\n== References ==", "ns": 0, "pageid": 3050504, "title": "Gerald Sacks"}}}, "limits": {"extracts": 20}, "warnings": {"extracts": {"*": "exlimit was too large for a whole article extracts request, lowered to 1"}, "main": {"*": "Unrecognized parameter: 'rvprop'"}}}
