After a postdoctoral position at Stanford University, he taught at Utrecht University.\nSince 1986, Barendregt has taught at Radboud University Nijmegen, where he now holds the Chair of Foundations of Mathematics and Computer Science. His research group works on Constructive Interactive Mathematics. He is also Adjunct Professor at Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, USA. He has been a visiting scholar at Darmstadt, ETH Zürich, Siena, and Kyoto.\nIn 1997 Barendregt was elected member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. On 6 February 2003 Barendregt was awarded the Spinozapremie for 2002, the highest scientific award in the Netherlands. In 2002 he was knighted in the Orde van de Nederlandse Leeuw.\nBarendregt received an honorary doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 2015.\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\nH.P. Barendregt (1985).
