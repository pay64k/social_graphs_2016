He has written extensively on the subject of free logic, a term which he coined.\n\n\n== Lambert's Law ==\nLambert's Law is the major principle in any free definite description theory that says: For all x, x = the y (A) if and only if (A(x/y) & for all y (if A then y = x)). Free logic itself is an adjustment of a given standard predicate logic such as to relieve it of existential assumptions, and so make it a free logic. Taking Bertrand Russell's predicate logic in his Principia Mathematica as standard, one replaces universal instantiation, \n  \n    \n      \n        ∀\n        x\n        \n        ϕ\n        x\n        →\n        ϕ\n        y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\forall x\\,\\phi x\\rightarrow \\phi y}\n  , with universal specification \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        ∀\n        x\n        \n        ϕ\n        x\n        ∧\n        E\n        !\n        y\n        \n        ϕ\n        y\n        )\n        →\n        ϕ\n        z\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (\\forall x\\,\\phi x\\land E!y\\,\\phi y)\\rightarrow \\phi z}\n  . Thus universal statements, like \"All men are mortal,\" or \"Everything is a unicorn,\" do not presuppose that there are men or that there is anything. These would be symbolized, with the appropriate predicates, as \n  \n    \n      \n        ∀\n        x\n        \n        (\n        M\n        x\n        →\n        L\n        x\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\forall x\\,(Mx\\rightarrow Lx)}\n   and \n  \n    \n      \n        ∀\n        x\n        \n        U\n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\forall x\\,Ux}\n  , which in Principia Mathematica entail \n  \n    \n      \n        ∃\n        x\n        \n        (\n        M\n        x\n        ∧\n        L\n        x\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\exists x\\,(Mx\\land Lx)}\n   and \n  \n    \n      \n        ∃\n        x\n        \n        U\n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\exists x\\,Ux}\n  , but not in free logic. The truth of these last statements, when used in a free logic, depend on the domain of quantification, which may be the null set.\n\n\n== Published works ==\nPhilosophical Applications of Free Logic, New York: Oxford University Press, 1991, \"A Theory of Definite Descriptions\", pp. 17–27, details an account of Russell's Theory of Descriptions in free logic. In the process, he demonstrates how a formulation from Hintikka allows for a contradiction by a correlate in logic to Russell's Paradox. He introduces the predicate \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        λ\n        x\n        )\n        (\n        ϕ\n        x\n        ∧\n        ¬\n        ϕ\n        x\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (\\lambda x)(\\phi x\\land \\neg \\phi x)}\n  \nFree Logic.
