For proving the undecidability of the word problem in groups he was awarded the Lenin Prize in 1957.\nIn 1953 he became a corresponding member of the USSR Academy of Sciences and in 1960 he was elected a full member.\nHe was married to the mathematician Lyudmila Keldysh (1904–1976). The mathematician Sergei Novikov is his son. Sergei Adian and Albert Muchnik were among his students.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nO'Connor, John J.; Robertson, Edmund F., \"Pyotr Novikov\", MacTutor History of Mathematics archive, University of St Andrews .\nPyotr Novikov at the Mathematics Genealogy Project", "ns": 0, "pageid": 1139033, "title": "Pyotr Novikov"}}}, "limits": {"extracts": 20}, "warnings": {"extracts": {"*": "exlimit was too large for a whole article extracts request, lowered to 1"}, "main": {"*": "Unrecognized parameter: 'rvprop'"}}}
