He was acknowledged by William James  as a forerunner of Pragmatism, although he viewed his work as a completion of Kant's project. Hodgson was a member of a London philosophy club with James, called the \"Scratch Eight.\" Hodgson regarded the poets William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge as his chief inspirations, and had no academic background, though he was a member of the Metaphysical Society.\nHe was the first president of the Aristotelian Society and held that post from 1880 to 1894.\nHis principal work was The Metaphysic of Experience (1898) which prepared the way for New Realism. He objected to the stance of empiricism in its postulating of persons and things, and insisted that neither subject nor object are warranted as initial considerations of philosophy.\nAttention to Hodgson was briefly enlivened by an article by Wolfe Mays in a British Phenomenology journal in the 1970s.\nThe volumes of Hodgson's principal work were often shipped with uncut pages and visits to libraries with these volumes has revealed that sometimes most pages of all 4 volumes remained uncut even one hundred years later.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nInternet Encyclopedia of Philosophy article on Hodgson\nPhilosophy of Reflection at openlibrary.org\nThe metaphysic of experience University of Wisconsin - Madison scan\nWm James on Hodgson", "ns": 0, "pageid": 285345, "title": "Shadworth Hodgson"}}}, "limits": {"extracts": 20}, "warnings": {"extracts": {"*": "exlimit was too large for a whole article extracts request, lowered to 1"}, "main": {"*": "Unrecognized parameter: 'rvprop'"}}}
