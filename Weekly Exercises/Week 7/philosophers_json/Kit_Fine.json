In addition to his primary areas of research, he has written papers in ancient philosophy, linguistics, computer science, and economic theory.\nFine has described his general approach to philosophy as follows: \"Iâ€™m firmly of the opinion that real progress in philosophy can only come from taking common sense seriously. A departure from common sense is usually an indication that a mistake has been made.\"\nFine has two daughters from his former marriage to Anne Fine. Anne Fine is an author of children's books; Cordelia Fine teaches at a university in Australia; Ione Fine is a professor at the University of Washington.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nSemantic Relationism.
