Three years later, after a legal case arising from the University's attempts to demote him as director and remove his endowed chair, he left the university. In 2009 he was appointed to the John B. Francis chair in bioethics at the Center for Practical Bioethics in Kansas City, succeeding John D. Lantos, inaugural holder of the chair.
