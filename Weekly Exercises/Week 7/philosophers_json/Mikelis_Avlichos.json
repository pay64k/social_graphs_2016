(Μικέλης) Άβλιχος; March 18, 1844 – November 28, 1917) was a Greek poet and scholar.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHe was born in Lixouri, Kefalonia. He remained in Lixouri until his graduation from the Petritsio high school and then completed his philosophical and philological education in Bern, Switzerland and other centres of Europe.\nIn his early years he was influenced by the radicals Andreas Laskaratos and Andreas Momferatos and during his teenage years was already associated with them. While in Bern, he met the Russian anarchists Mikhail Bakunin and Peter Kropotkin and he adopted their philosophies.\nHis poetry follows the Heptanisian tradition and he was the last to write in this style. His reasoning was revolutionary and he opposed the social order he lived in.\nAs the poet Kostis Palamas wrote in his obituary, \"He was negative to the current social structure and he hated militarism and war\".\nIn his poetry referred to political or social affairs, treating them satirically or ironically. He is characterized as an atheist, a theoretical anarchist and a radical.\nIn 1887, after ten years of study abroad, he moved to Corfu due to health reasons and at the age of 34, he returned to Lixouri, where he lived until his death.\nHis poems were published posthumously and many of them became songs.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nAntidogma Νο. 2 (magazine), Nafplio, 2006.\nJames Sotros, The Greek Speaking Anarchist and Revolutionary Movement (1830-1940) - Writings for a History, in: No Gods-No Masters, December 2004", "ns": 0, "pageid": 12190707, "title": "Mikelis Avlichos"}}}, "limits": {"extracts": 20}, "warnings": {"extracts": {"*": "exlimit was too large for a whole article extracts request, lowered to 1"}, "main": {"*": "Unrecognized parameter: 'rvprop'"}}}
