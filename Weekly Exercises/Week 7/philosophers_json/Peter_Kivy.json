He studies particularly the philosophy of music.\nHe earned master's degrees in both philosophy (University of Michigan, 1958) and musicology (Yale University, 1960). He earned his PhD at Columbia University in 1966. He joined the faculty at Rutgers the following year, and became full professor in 1976. He taught there for his whole career except one year as a visiting professor at University of California, Santa Barbara.\nHis early work is on the 18th-century British aesthetics, and was influenced by Francis Hutcheson. From there he developed an interest in analytic aesthetics. From the late 1970s on, he has been interested mainly in music philosophy. His book The Corded Shell made him a central figure in music aesthetics.\nOne preoccupation of his has been the problem of what it means for instrumental music to \"express\" an emotion. His answer is that common emotions have physical behavioral expression in people that can be understood by appearance and imitated in music; thus, music cannot express more complex emotions that do not have an obvious behavioral expression. A similar position is followed by Stephen Davies.\n\n\n== Books ==\nSpeaking of Art (1973).\nFrancis Hutcheson's Inquiry Concerning Beauty, Order, Harmony, Design (ed., 1973).\nThomas Reid's Lectures on the Fine Arts (ed., 1973).\nThe Seventh Sense: A Study of Francis Hutcheson's Aesthetics, and its Influence in Eighteenth-Century Britain (1976, 2nd ed. 2003).\nThe Corded Shell: Reflections on Musical Expression (1980).\nSound and Semblance: Reflections on Musical Representation (1984, 2nd ed. 1991).\nOsmin's Rage: Philosophical Reflections on Opera, Drama and Text (1988, 2nd ed.).\nSound Sentiment: An Essay on Musical Emotions (1989).\nMusic Alone: Philosophical Reflections on the Purely Musical Experience (1990).\nEssays on the History of Aesthetics (ed., 1992)\nThe Fine Art of Repetition: And Other Essays in the Philosophy of Music (collection, 1993)\nAuthenticities: Philosophical Reflections on Musical Performance (1995).\nPhilosophies of Arts: An Essay in Differences (1997).\nNew Essays on Musical Understanding (collection, 2001)\nThe Possessor and the Possessed: Handel, Mozart, Beethoven and Idea of Musical Genius (2001).\nIntroduction to a Philosophy of Music (2002).\nThe Blackwell Guide to Aesthetics (ed., 2004)\nThe Performance of Reading: an Essay in the Philosophy of Literature (2006).\nMusic, Language, and Cognition: And Other Essays in the Philosophy of Music, further collected essays of Peter Kivy (collection, 2007).\nAntithetical Arts: On the Ancient Quarrel Between Literature and Music (2009).\nSounding Off: Eleven Essays in the Philosophy of Music (2012).\n\n\n== Reception ==\nSome criticism of Kivy's ideas is available in Music, Philosophy, and Modernity by Andrew Bowie, 2007.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nNaomi Cumming. \"Peter Kivy.\" Grove Music Online, ed.
