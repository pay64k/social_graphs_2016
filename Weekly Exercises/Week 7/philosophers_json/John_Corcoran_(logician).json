{"batchcomplete": "", "query": {"normalized": [{"to": "John Corcoran (logician)", "from": "John_Corcoran_(logician)"}], "pages": {"23686234": {"extract": "John Corcoran (born 1937) is a logician, philosopher, mathematician, and historian of logic. He is best known for his philosophical work on concepts such as the nature of inference, relations between conditions, argument-deduction-proof distinctions, the relationship between logic and epistemology, and the place of proof theory and model theory in logic. Nine of Corcoran’s papers have been translated into Spanish, Portuguese, Persian, and Arabic; his 1989 \"signature\" essay was translated into three languages. Fourteen of his papers have been reprinted; one was reprinted twice.\nHis work on Aristotle’s logic of the Prior Analytics is regarded as being highly faithful both to the Greek text and to the historical context. It is the basis for many subsequent investigations. It was adopted for the 1989 translation of the Prior Analytics by Robin Smith and for the 2009 translation of the Prior Analytics Book A by Gisela Striker. A bibliography of Corcoran’s publications on Aristotle's logic is available at ResearchGate. https://www.researchgate.net/profile/John_Corcoran2/\nCorcoran’s 2014 paper with Hassan Masoud – “Existential import today: New metatheorems; historical, philosophical, and pedagogical misconceptions” – is currently first on the “most-read” list at History and Philosophy of Logic. His mathematical results on definitional equivalence of formal string theories, sciences of strings of characters over finite alphabets, are foundational for logic, formal linguistics, and computer science. A current list of all of Corcoran’s publications is available at ResearchGate. https://www.researchgate.net/profile/John_Corcoran2/\n\n\n== Education ==\nCorcoran studied engineering at the Baltimore Polytechnic Institute, Advanced Curriculum Engineering 1956, and the Johns Hopkins University, BES Mechanical Engineering 1959. After briefly working in engineering, he studied philosophy at the Johns Hopkins University: MA Philosophy 1962, PhD. Philosophy 1963. Post-doctoral study: Yeshiva University, Mathematics 1964 and University of California Berkeley, Mathematics 1965. Dissertation: Generative Structure of Two-valued Logics; Supervisor Robert McNaughton (PhD student of Willard Van Orman Quine).\nCorcoran’s student years, the late 1950s and early 1960s, were wonderful times to be learning logic, its history, and its philosophy. His first logic teacher was Albert Hammond, who passed on from his own dissertation supervisor Arthur Lovejoy the tradition of the history of ideas—a tradition that his university, The Johns Hopkins University, had become famous for. Corcoran studied Plato and Aristotle with Ludwig Edelstein, the historian of Greek science and medicine who held appointments both at The Johns Hopkins University and at its School of Medicine. His next two logic teachers were both accomplished and knowledgeable symbolic logicians: Joseph Ullian, a Quine PhD, and Richard Wiebe, a Mates PhD who had studied with Carnap and Tarski. Corcoran’s dissertation supervisor, his doctor father, was Robert McNaughton, a Quine PhD who had already made a name for himself in three fields: the metamathematics of number theory, the theory of formal languages, and the theory of automata. McNaughton encouraged Corcoran to do post-doctoral studies at Yeshiva University in New York City with Raymond Smullyan and Martin Davis, both doctoral students of Alonzo Church. McNaughton later encouraged Corcoran to go to UC Berkeley, the world center for logic and methodology, and he recommended Corcoran to his Berkeley colleagues. He was also instrumental in Corcoran’s move to his first tenure-track position, at the University of Pennsylvania, where McNaughton was a Professor of Computer and Information Science. In those early years Corcoran also attended semester-long courses and seminars by several other logicians, including John Addison, a Stephen Kleene PhD, Leon Henkin, another Church PhD, and John Myhill, another Quine PhD. Corcoran often mentions his teachers with great respect and warmth.\n\n\n== Regular academic or research appointments ==\nHe has been Professor of Philosophy, University at Buffalo (SUNY), 1973–; Associate Professor of Philosophy, University at Buffalo, 1970–1973; Assistant Professor of Linguistics, University of Pennsylvania, 1965–1969; Member of Linguistics Group, IBM Research Center, 1963–1964.\n\n\n== Visiting academic or research appointments ==\nHe is or was Visiting Professor of Logic, University of Santiago de Compostela 1994; Visiting Scholar, Linguistic Institute, SUNY Oswego 1976; NSF Seminar Project Director, Linguistic Institute, University at Buffalo 1971; Visiting Associate Professor of Philosophy and Research Associate, University of Michigan 1969–1970; Visiting Lecturer in Philosophy, University of California, Berkeley 1964–1965; Mathematician, General Electric Research Laboratory 1962; Mathematician, Aeronca Astromechanics Institute, 1961; Junior Instructor in Philosophy, Johns Hopkins University 1960–1961.\n\n\n== Research profile ==\nCorcoran’s work in history of logic involves most of the discipline’s productive periods. He has discussed Aristotle, the Stoics, William of Ockham, Giovanni Girolamo Saccheri, George Boole, Richard Dedekind, Gottlob Frege, Charles Sanders Peirce, Clarence Irving Lewis, the American Postulate Theorists, Alfred Tarski, Willard Van Orman Quine, and Warren Goldfarb.\nHis 1972 interpretation of Aristotle’s Prior Analytics, proposed independently by Timothy Smiley at about the same time, has been found to be more faithful than previous interpretations both to the Greek text and to the historical context. It has formed the basis for subsequent investigations by Edgar Andrade, George Boger, Manuel Correia, Paolo Crivelli, Newton da Costa, Catarina Dutilh, Paolo Fait, Nicolas Fillion, James Gasser, Klaus Glashoff, John Martin, Mary Mulhern, Michael Scanlan, Robin Smith, Neil Tennant, and others. It was adopted for the 1989 translation of the Prior Analytics by Robin Smith and for the 2009 translation of the Prior Analytics Book A by Gisela Striker.\nHis 1980 critical reconstruction of Boole’s original 1847 system revealed previously unnoticed gaps and errors in Boole’s work and established the essentially Aristotelian basis of Boole’s philosophy of logic. A 2003 article provides a systematic comparison and critical evaluation of Aristotelian logic and Boolean logic; it also reveals the centrality of wholistic reference in Boole's philosophy of logic. According to Corcoran, Boole fully accepted and endorsed Aristotle’s logic. Boole did not dispute one point that Aristotle made, but he did “go under, over, and beyond” Aristotle’s logic by 1) providing it with mathematical foundations involving equations,2) extending the class of problems it could treat—to assessing validity he added solving equations--,and 3) expanding the range of applications it could handle—e.g. from propositions having only two terms to those having arbitrarily many.\nMore specifically, Boole agreed with what Aristotle said; Boole’s ‘disagreements’, if they might be called that, concern what Aristotle did not say. First, in the realm of foundations, Boole reduced Aristotle’s four propositional forms of to one form, that of equations—-by itself a revolutionary idea. Second, in the realm of logic’s problems, Boole’s addition of equation solving to logic—-another revolutionary idea—-involved Boole’s doctrine that Aristotle’s rules of inference (the “perfect syllogisms”) must be supplemented by rules for equation solving. Third, in the realm of applications, Boole’s system could handle multi-term propositions and arguments whereas Aristotle could handle only two-termed subject-predicate propositions and arguments. For example, Aristotle’s system could not deduce “No quadrangle that is a square is a rectangle that is a rhombus” from “No square that is a quadrangle is a rhombus that is a rectangle” or from “No rhombus that is a rectangle is a square that is a quadrangle”.\nHis collaboration with Alfred Tarski in the late 1970s and early 1980s led to publications on Tarski’s work and to the 2007 article Notes on the Founding of Logics and Metalogic: Aristotle, Boole, and Tarski, which traces Aristotelian and Boolean ideas in Tarski’s work and which confirms Tarski’s status as a founding figure in logic on a par with Aristotle and Boole.\n\n\n== Scientific work ==\nHis work in philosophy of logic focuses on the nature of logic, the role of logic in inquiry, the conceptual structure of logic, the metaphysical and epistemological presuppositions of logic, the nature of mathematical logic and the gaps between logical theory and mathematical practice. His mathematical logic treats propositional logics, modal logics, identity logics, syllogistic logics, the logic of first-order variable-binding term operators, second-order logics, model theory, and the theory of strings – a discipline which is foundational in all areas of logic and which provides essential background for all of his other mathematical work. In philosophy of mathematics Corcoran has been guided by a nuanced and inclusionary Platonism which strives to do justice to all aspects of mathematical and logical experience including those aspects emphasized by competing philosophical perspectives such as logicism, constructivism, deductivism, and formalism. Although several of his philosophical papers presuppose little history or mathematics, his historical papers often involve either original philosophy (e.g. his recent BSL article “Schemata”) or original mathematics (e.g. his 1980 HPL article “Categoricity”). He has referred to the mathematical dimension of his approach to history as mathematical archaeology. His philosophical papers often involve original historical research. He has been guided by the Aristotelian principle that the nature of modern thought is sometimes best understood in light of its historical development, a view that he attributes to Arthur Lovejoy’s History of Ideas Program at Johns Hopkins University and in which he has been encouraged by the American philosopher and historian Peter Hare.\n\n\n== Collaboration ==\n\nMany of Corcoran’s articles and reviews are co-authored and many of his single-author publications acknowledge involvement of colleagues and students. Corcoran emphasizes the intensely and essentially personal nature of all genuine knowledge including logical knowledge. Nevertheless, he also stresses the importance of communities of knowers and how much each person can benefit in the personal search for truth from critical cooperation with other objective researchers. For over 40 years he was the leader of the “Buffalo Syllogistic Group”—a community of philosophers, historians, linguists, logicians, and mathematicians dedicated to the study of the origin of logic. The achievements of this community are sketched in his 2009 paper “Aristotle’s Logic at the University at Buffalo’s Department of Philosophy”, Ideas y Valores: Revista Colombiana de Filosofía 140 (August 2009) 99–117. A list of his publications, complete through 2000, appears in the 1999 volume of History and Philosophy of Logic, which also includes the expository article by M. Scanlan and S. Shapiro “The Work of John Corcoran: An Appreciation”. Other articles about his work include “Corcoran the Mathematician” by S. Shapiro, “Corcoran the Philosopher” by J. M. Sagüillo, and “Corcoran in Spanish” by C. Martínez-Vidal; all appear in a 2007 volume published by the University of Santiago de Compostela Press. Corcoran’s work in the 1990s on information-theoretic logic is discussed by José M. Sagüillo in the article “Methodological Practice and Complementary Concepts of Logical Consequence: Tarski's Model-Theoretic Consequence and Corcoran's Information-Theoretic Consequence” (History and Philosophy of Logic volume 30, 2009, 21-48), which received the 2009 Ivor Grattan-Guinness Award for the History and Philosophy of Logic ( http://informaworld.com/thpl ).\n\n\n== Publications ==\nThree Logical Theories.
