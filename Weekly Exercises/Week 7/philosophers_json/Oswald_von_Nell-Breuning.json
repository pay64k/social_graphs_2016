He was instrumental in the drafting of Pope Pius XI's social encyclical Quadragesimo anno (1931), which – like the earlier Rerum novarum (1891), after which it was named – dealt with the \"Social Question\" and developed the principle of subsidiarity. Nell-Breuning was not allowed to publish from 1936 to the end of Nazi Germany in 1945. He died in Frankfurt am Main.\n\n\n== References ==\nOswald von Nell-Breuning (1890-1991)—Katholischer Sozialethiker, Sozialphilosoph und Sozialwissenschaftler", "ns": 0, "pageid": 206650, "title": "Oswald von Nell-Breuning"}}}, "limits": {"extracts": 20}, "warnings": {"extracts": {"*": "exlimit was too large for a whole article extracts request, lowered to 1"}, "main": {"*": "Unrecognized parameter: 'rvprop'"}}}
