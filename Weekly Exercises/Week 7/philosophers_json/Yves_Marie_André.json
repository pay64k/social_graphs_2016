Although distinguished in his scholastic studies, he adhered to Gallicanism and Jansenism and was thus considered unsuitable for responsible office by Church authorities. He therefore pursued scientific studies and became royal professor of mathematics at Caen.\nHe is best known for his Essai sur le Beau (Essay on Beauty), a 1741 philosophical work on aesthetics, which made him famous at the time and remained a well-known work into the 19th century.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nŒuvres Philosophiques du Père André Collected works on the Internet Archive\nEssay on Beauty Annotated English translation of Essai sur le Beau", "ns": 0, "pageid": 6813298, "title": "Yves Marie André"}}}, "limits": {"extracts": 20}, "warnings": {"extracts": {"*": "exlimit was too large for a whole article extracts request, lowered to 1"}, "main": {"*": "Unrecognized parameter: 'rvprop'"}}}
