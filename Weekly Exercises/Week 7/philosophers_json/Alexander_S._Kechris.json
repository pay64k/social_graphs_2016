He has made major contributions to the theory of Borel equivalence relations and the theory of automorphism groups of uncountable structures.\nKechris earned his Ph.D. in 1972 under the direction of Yiannis N. Moschovakis, with a dissertation titled Projective Ordinals and Countable Analytic Sets.\nIn 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\nA. S.
