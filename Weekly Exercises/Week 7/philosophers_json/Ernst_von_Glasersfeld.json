He was a member of the Board of Trustees, American Society of Cybernetics, from which he received the McCulloch Memorial Award in 1991. He was a member of the Scientific Board, Instituto Piaget, Lisbon.\nVon Glasersfeld coined the term radical constructivism and spent large parts of his life in Ireland (1940s), in Italy (1950s) where he worked with Silvio Ceccato, and in the US. Elaborating upon Giambattista Vico, Jean Piaget's genetic epistemology, Bishop Berkeley's theory of perception, James Joyce's Finnegans Wake, and other important texts, von Glasersfeld developed his model of Radical Constructivism, which is an ethos shared by all of these writers to one degree or another.\nErnst von Glasersfeld’s literary estate is administered and curated at the Ernst-von-Glasersfeld-Archive at the University of Innsbruck.\n\n\n== Honors and awards ==\n1991: Warren McCulloch Memorial Award of the American Society for Cybernetics\n1997: Honorary doctorate of the University of Klagenfurt\n2002: Reconnaissance du Mérite scientifique of the University of Quebec\n2005: The Wiener Gold Medal of the American Society for Cybernetics\n2005: Gregory Bateson-award of the Heidelberg Institute for Systemic Research e.V.\n2007: Journal of constructivist foundations honoured him on his 90th birthday with a Festschrift Glasersfeld\n2007: Austrian Cross of Honour for Science and Art, 1st class\n2008: Honorary doctorate of the University of Innsbruck\n2009: Honorary Medal of the City of Vienna in gold\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\n\nGlasersfeld, E. von, (2001) The radical constructivist view of science.
