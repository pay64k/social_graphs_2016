Since 2009, she has also served as Director of the Women's and Gender Studies program.\nShe has published in metaphysics, feminist metaphysics, epistemology, feminist theory, ancient philosophy, and social and political philosophy. Much of her work has focused on persistence and endurance through change; objectivity and objectification; and Catharine MacKinnon's theory of gender. She has done groundbreaking work on the social construction of categories often considered to be natural kinds, particularly race and gender. A collection of her major papers on these topics recently appeared as Resisting Reality: Social Construction and Social Critique (Oxford University Press, 2012) which won the prestigious Joseph B. Gittler Award of the American Philosophical Association in 2014. This prize is given for an outstanding scholarly contribution in the field of the philosophy of one or more of the social sciences. The range of the social sciences is construed broadly so as to include anthropology, economics, education, government, history, psychology, sociology, and any other field that is normally located within the social science division in contemporary colleges and universities.\nHaving graduated from Reed College in 1977, she earned her Ph.D. in 1985 from the University of California, Berkeley. She has taught at Princeton University, University of Pennsylvania and University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.\nHaslanger was selected as the 2011 Carus Lecturer by the American Philosophical Association. The Society for Women in Philosophy named her a 2010 Distinguished Woman Philosopher, citing her as one of the \"best analytic feminists\" in the United States. Haslanger was the President of the Eastern Division of the American Philosophical Association and was elected to the American Academy of Arts & Sciences in 2015.\nHaslanger co-edits the Symposia on Gender, Race and Philosophy, an online publication for recent philosophical work on gender and race.\nShe is married to fellow MIT philosopher Stephen Yablo.\nShe has a son, Isaac, who attends Howard University in Washington, D.C. and a daughter, Zina, who attends college in Massachusetts.\n\n\n== Published works ==\nBooks\nResisting Reality: Social Construction and Social Critique, Oxford University Press, 2012.\nPersistence: Contemporary Readings (co-edited with Roxanne Marie Kurtz), MIT Press, 2006.
