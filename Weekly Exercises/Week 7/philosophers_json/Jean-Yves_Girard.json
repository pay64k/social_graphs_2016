He is the research director (emeritus) at the mathematical institute of Luminy.\nHe obtained the CNRS Silver medal in 1983 and is a member of the French Academy of Sciences.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nJean-Yves Girard is an alumnus of the École normale supérieure de Saint-Cloud.\nHe made a name for himself in the 1970s with his proof of strong normalization in a system of second-order logic called System F. This result gave a new proof of Takeuti's conjecture, which was proven a few years earlier by William W. Tait, Moto-o Takahashi and Dag Prawitz. For this purpose, he introduced the notion of reducibility candidate (\"candidat de réducibilité\"). He is also credited with the discovery of linear logic; the geometry of interaction; ludics; and the mustard watch.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nErnest Nagel; James R.
