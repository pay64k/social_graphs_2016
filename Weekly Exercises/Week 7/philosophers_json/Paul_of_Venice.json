He was teacher to Paolo da Pergola.\n\n\n== Life ==\nHe was born, according to the chroniclers of his order, at Udine, about 1369 and died at Venice on June 15, 1429, as Paolo Nicoletti. He joined the Augustinian Order at around 1383, at the convent of Santo Stefano in Venice. In 1390 he is said to have been sent to Oxford for his studies in theology, but returned to Italy, and finished his course at Padua. He lectured in the University at Padua during the first quarter of the fifteenth century.\nPaul was one of the theologians called to Rome in 1427 by Pope Martin V, to take cognizance of the charges brought against St. Bernardino of Siena, occasioned by Bernardino's use of inscriptions of the name of Jesus in worship.\n\n\n== Realism ==\nWith regard to the problem of universals he adhered to realism, since he maintained that universal essences are real entities.\n\n\n== Works ==\nHis writings show a wide knowledge and interest in the scientific problems of his time.\nCommentaries on the works of Aristotle:\nExpositio in libros Posteriorum Aristotelis.\nExpositio super VIII libros Physicorum necnon super Commento Averrois (1409).\nExpositio super libros De generatione et corruptione.\nLectura super librum De Anima.\nConclusiones Ethicorum.\nConclusiones Politicorum.\nExpositio super Praedicabilia et Praedicamenta (1428).\n\nLogical works:\nLogica Parva or Tractatus Summularum (1395–96).\nLogica Magna (1397–98).\nQuadratura.\nSophismata Aurea.\n\nOther works:\nSuper Primum Sententiarum Johannis de Ripa Lecturae Abbreviatio (1401).\nSumma philosophiae naturalis (1408).\nDe compositione mundi.\nQuaestiones adversus Judaeos.\nSermones.\n\n\n== English translations ==\nLogica Parva.
