He received his Ph.D. from Princeton University in 1964 under the tutelage of Alonzo Church. He received the Herbrand Award in 2003. His research group designed the TPS automated theorem prover. A subsystem ETPS (Educational Theorem Proving System) of TPS is used to help students learn logic by interactively constructing natural deduction proofs.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nAndrews, Peter B.
