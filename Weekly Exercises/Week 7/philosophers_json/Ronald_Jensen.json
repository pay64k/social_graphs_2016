His supervisor was Gisbert Hasenjaeger. Jensen taught at Rockefeller University, 1969–71, and the University of California, Berkeley, 1971-73. The balance of his academic career was spent in Europe at the University of Bonn, the University of Oslo, the University of Freiburg, the University of Oxford, and the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, from which he retired in 2001. He now resides in Berlin.\nIn 2015 the European Set Theory Society awarded him and John R. Steel the Hausdorff medal for their paper \"K without a measurable\".\n\n\n== Results ==\nJensen's better-known results include the:\nAxiomatic set theory NFU, a variant of New Foundations (NF) where extensionality is weakened to allow several sets with no elements, and the proof of NFU's consistency relative to Peano arithmetic;\nFine structure theory of the constructible universe L. This work led to his being awarded in 2003 the Leroy P. Steele Prize for Seminal Contribution to Research of the American Mathematical Society for his 1972 paper titled \"The fine structure of the constructible hierarchy\";\nDefinitions and proofs of various infinitary combinatorial principles in L, including diamond \n  \n    \n      \n        ♢\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\diamondsuit }\n  , square, and morass;\nJensen's covering theorem for L;\nGeneral theory of core models and the construction of the Dodd–Jensen core model;\nConsistency of CH plus Suslin's hypothesis.\nTechnique of coding the universe by a real.\n\n\n== External links ==\nJensen's page at the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin.\nBrief biographies of past presidents of the Kurt Gödel Society.", "ns": 0, "pageid": 3785996, "title": "Ronald Jensen"}}}, "limits": {"extracts": 20}, "warnings": {"extracts": {"*": "exlimit was too large for a whole article extracts request, lowered to 1"}, "main": {"*": "Unrecognized parameter: 'rvprop'"}}}
