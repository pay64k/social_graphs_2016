For many years he has split his time between UCLA and University of Athens . His book Descriptive Set Theory (North-Holland) is the primary reference for the subject. He is especially associated with the development of the effective, or lightface, version of descriptive set theory.\nMoschovakis earned his Ph.D. from University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1963 under the direction of Stephen Kleene, with a dissertation entitled Recursive Analysis. In 2015 he was elected as a fellow of the American Mathematical Society \"for contributions to mathematical logic, especially set theory and computability theory, and for exposition\".\nMoschovakis is married to Joan Moschovakis, with whom he gave the 2014 Lindström Lectures at the University of Gothenburg.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nElementary induction on abstract structures.
