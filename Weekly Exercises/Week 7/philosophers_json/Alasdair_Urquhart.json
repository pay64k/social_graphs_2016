He has made notable contributions to the field of logic, especially non-classical logic. One of his most notable achievements is proving the undecidability of the relevance logic R. He also published numerous papers in major theoretical computer science venues, mostly on mathematical logic topics of relevance to computer science.\nA native of Scotland, Urquhart received his MA in Philosophy from the University of Edinburgh in 1967, and his Ph.D. from the University of Pittsburgh in 1973 under the supervision of Alan Ross Anderson and Nuel Belnap.\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\n\"The Undecidability of Entailment and Relevant Implication.\" Journal of Symbolic Logic 49(4): 1059-1073 (1984).\nwith Stephen A.
