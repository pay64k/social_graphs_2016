She also opposes [[eco-feminism]].\n\n== Education ==\nBiehl graduated from Wesleyan University in 1974.  While living in New York City, she made her living as a copyeditor for major book publishers and studied theater and art. In 1986 she attended the [[Institute for Social Ecology]], where she met the social theorist Murray Bookchin.  In January 1987 she moved to [[Burlington, Vermont]], to study further with Bookchin. They began a collaborative relationship to advance and promote social ecology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cedap.assis.unesp.br/cantolibertario/textos/0022.html|title=Janet Biehl: Short Biography & Selected Works|publisher=Canto Libertário|accessdate=19 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Career ==\nFrom 1987 to 2003 they co-wrote and co-published the theoretical newsletter ''Green Perspectives'', later renamed ''Left Green Perspectives''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.social-ecology.org/category/social-ecology-journals/left-green-perspectives/|title=Left Green Perspectives (1988-1998)|publisher=Institute for Social Ecology|accessdate=19 September 2011}}</ref> BIehl edited and compiled ''The Murray Bookchin Reader'' (1997), which Bookchin considered to be the best introduction to his work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/bookchin/reader/intro.html|title=The Murray Bookchin Reader: Introduction|last=Biehl|first=Janet|publisher=Anarchy Archives|accessdate=19 September 2011}}</ref> To summarize Bookchin's ideas on assembly democracy, known as [[libertarian municipalism]], she wrote ''The Politics of Social Ecology:  Libertarian Municipalism'' (1998). She wrote numerous articles about or related to Bookchin’s  ideas.  \n\nSince Bookchin's death in 2006, she authored ''Ecology or Catastrophe: The  Life of Murray Bookchin,'' published in 2015 by Oxford University Press. In 2011 Biehl separated from social ecology, explaining that she could no longer advocate an antistatist ideology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.social-ecology.org/2011/04/biehl-breaks-with-social-ecology/|title=Biehl breaks with social ecology|last=Biehl|first=Janet|date=April 13, 2011 <!-- at 6:10 am --> |publisher=Institute for Social Ecology|accessdate=19 September 2011}}</ref> She blogs at [http://www.biehlonbookchin.com/ Ecology or Catastrophe].\n\nBiehl is a supporter of the Kurdish freedom movement. After [[Abdullah Öcalan]], leader of the insurgent [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]], was captured and imprisoned in 1999, he became an avid reader of Bookchin's work in Turkish translation and recommended it to the movement. Drawing on libertarian municipalism, he formulated [[democratic confederalism]] as a political program, which the PKK adopted.<ref>Janet Biehl, \"Bookchin, Öcalan, and the Dialectics of Democracy,\" New Compass (2012), http://new-compass.net/articles/bookchin-%C3%B6calan-and-dialectics-democracy</ref> In 2004 several intermediaries tried to arrange a dialogue between Bookchin and Öcalan but were unsuccessful due to Bookchin's failing health. (PDFs of the correspondence are published [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/syrian-kurds-murray-bookchin_us_5655e7e2e4b079b28189e3df here]). In 2012 Biehl translated (German to English) the [http://demokratischeautonomie.blogsport.eu/ book] ''Democratic Autonomy in North Kurdistan'' by the solidarity group TATORT Kurdistan, a field study of democratic institutions built by the Kurdish movement in southeastern Turkey to implement democratic confederalism.\n\nIn 2014 and 2015 she visited [[Rojava]], the mostly Kurdish region of northern Syria. There the Kurdish movement is attempting, in wartime conditions, to implement democratic confederalism, gender equality, and ecology.<ref>Wes Enzinna, \"A Dream of Secular Utopia in ISIS' Backyard,\" New York Times Magazine, November 24, 2015, http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/29/magazine/a-dream-of-utopia-in-hell.html?_r=0</ref>  She published several articles about her visits.<ref>Biehl, \"Rojava's Communes and Councils,\" January 31, 2015, http://www.biehlonbookchin.com/rojavas-communes-and-councils/; \"Revolutionary Education,\" February 7, 2015, http://www.biehlonbookchin.com/revolutionary-education/; \"Rojava's Threefold Economy,\" February 25, 2015, http://www.biehlonbookchin.com/rojavas-threefold-economy/; \"Thoughts on Rojava,\" February 16, 2016, http://www.biehlonbookchin.com/thoughts-on-rojava/; and with others, \"Joint Statement of the Academic Delegation,\" January 17, 2015, http://www.biehlonbookchin.com/joint-statement-delegation/</ref> In October 2016 her translation of ''Revolution in Rojava: Democratic Autonomy and Women's Liberation in Northern Syria,'' written by Michael Knapp, Anja Flach, and Ercan Ayboga, was published by Pluto Press.\n\n== Selected works ==\n* {{cite book | last = Biehl | first = Janet | title = Finding Our Way: Rethinking Ecofeminist Politics | publisher = Black Rose Books | location = Montreal | year = 1991 | isbn = 0921689780 }}\n* {{cite book | last = Biehl | first = Janet | title = Ecofascism: Lessons from the German Experience | publisher = AK Press | location = Edinburgh and San Francisco | year = 1995 | isbn = 1873176732 }}\n* {{cite book | last1 = Biehl | first1 = Janet (editor) | title = The Murray Bookchin Reader | publisher = Cassell | location = London | year = 1997 | isbn = 0304338745 }}\n* {{cite book | last = Biehl | first = Janet | title = The Politics of Social Ecology: Libertarian Municipalism | publisher = Black Rose Books | location = Montreal | year = 1998 | isbn = 1551641003 }}\n* {{cite book | last = Biehl | first = Janet | title = Mumford Gutkind Bookchin: The Emergence of Eco-decentralism | publisher = New Compass | location = Porsgrunn, Norway | year = 2011 | isbn = 9788293064107 }}\n* {{cite book | last = Biehl | first = Janet | title = Ecology or Catastrophe: The Life of Murray Bookchin | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York | year = 2015 | isbn = 0199342482 }}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Goodreads author}}\n* {{Facebook|janet.biehl|Janet Biehl}}\n* {{Twitter}}\n* [http://www.biehlonbookchin.com Ecology or Catastrophe]\n\n{{subject bar|portal1= Biography | portal2= Literature | portal3= Feminism | portal4= Environment | portal5= Libertarianism}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Biehl, Janet}}\n[[Category:1953 births]]\n[[Category:American feminists]]\n[[Category:American libertarians]]\n[[Category:American political philosophers]]\n[[Category:American political writers]]\n[[Category:Libertarian theorists]]\n[[Category:Feminist studies scholars]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Social ecology]]\n[[Category:Green anarchists]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Janet Biehl"}}}}
