It was only in the 20th century that his [[Law of Continuity]] and [[Transcendental Law of Homogeneity]] found mathematical implementation (by means of [[non-standard analysis]]). He became one of the most prolific inventors in the field of [[mechanical calculator]]s. While working on adding automatic multiplication and division to [[Pascal's calculator]], he was the first to describe a [[pinwheel calculator]] in 1685<ref>[[#SMITH|David Smith]], pp. 173–181 (1929)</ref> and invented the [[Leibniz wheel]], used in the [[arithmometer]], the first mass-produced mechanical calculator. He also refined the [[binary number]] system, which is the foundation of virtually all digital [[computer]]s.\n\nIn philosophy, Leibniz is most noted for his [[Philosophical optimism|optimism]], i.e. his conclusion that our [[Universe]] is, in a restricted sense, the [[Best of all possible worlds|best possible one]] that [[God]] could have created, an idea that was often lampooned by others such as [[Voltaire]]. Leibniz, along with [[René Descartes]] and [[Baruch Spinoza]], was one of the three great 17th-century advocates of [[rationalism]]. The work of Leibniz anticipated modern [[logic]] and [[analytic philosophy]], but his philosophy also looks back to the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] tradition, in which conclusions are produced by applying reason to first principles or prior definitions rather than to empirical evidence.\n\nLeibniz made major contributions to [[physics]] and [[technology]], and anticipated notions that surfaced much later in [[philosophy]], [[probability theory]], [[biology]], [[medicine]], [[geology]], [[psychology]], [[linguistics]], and [[computer science]]. He wrote works on philosophy, [[politics]], [[law]], [[ethics]], [[theology]], [[history]], and [[philology]]. Leibniz's contributions to this vast array of subjects were scattered in various [[learned journal]]s, in tens of thousands of letters, and in unpublished manuscripts.

Her teachings influenced Leibniz's philosophical thoughts in his later life.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nLeibniz's father had been a Professor of Moral Philosophy at the [[University of Leipzig]], and the boy later inherited his father's personal library. He was given free access to it from the age of seven. While Leibniz's schoolwork was largely confined to the study of a small [[Canon (basic principle)|canon]] of authorities, his father's library enabled him to study a wide variety of advanced philosophical and theological works—ones that he would not have otherwise been able to read until his college years.<ref>Mackie (1845), 21</ref> Access to his father's library, largely written in [[Latin]], also led to his proficiency in the Latin language, which he achieved by the age of 12.  He also composed 300 [[hexameters]] of [[Latin poetry|Latin verse]], in a single morning, for a special event at school at the age of 13.<ref>Mackie (1845), 22</ref>\n\nIn April 1661 he enrolled in his father's former university at age 15,<ref name=\"Arthur p. 16\"/><ref>Mackie (1845), 26</ref> and completed his [[bachelor's degree]] in Philosophy in December 1662. He defended his ''Disputatio Metaphysica de Principio Individui'' (''Metaphysical Disputation on the Principle of Individuation''),<ref name=\"Arthur p. x\">Arthur 2014, p. x.</ref> which addressed the [[principle of individuation]], on June 9, 1663. Leibniz earned his master's degree in Philosophy on February 7, 1664. He published and defended a [[dissertation]] ''Specimen Quaestionum Philosophicarum ex Jure collectarum'' (''An Essay of Collected Philosophical Problems of Right''),<ref name=\"Arthur p. x\"/> arguing for both a theoretical and a pedagogical relationship between philosophy and law, in December 1664. After one year of legal studies, he was awarded his bachelor's degree in Law on September 28, 1665.<ref>Hubertus Busche, ''Leibniz' Weg ins perspektivische Universum: Eine Harmonie im Zeitalter der Berechnung'', Meiner Verlag, 1997, p. 120.</ref> His dissertation was titled ''De conditionibus'' (''On Conditions'').<ref name=\"Arthur p. x\"/>\n\nIn early 1666, at age 19, Leibniz wrote his first book, ''[[De Arte Combinatoria]]'' (''On the Combinatorial Art''), the first part of which was also his [[habilitation]] [[thesis]] in Philosophy, which he defended in March 1666.<ref name=\"Arthur p. x\"/><ref>A few copies of ''De Arte Combinatoria'' were produced as requested for the habilitation procedure; it was reprinted without his consent in 1690.</ref> His next goal was to earn his license and Doctorate in Law, which normally required three years of study. In 1666, the University of Leipzig turned down Leibniz's doctoral application and refused to grant him a [[Doctorate]] in Law, most likely due to his relative youth.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jolley|first=Nicholas|title=The Cambridge Companion to Leibniz|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}:20</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Simmons|first=George|title=Calculus Gems: Brief Lives and Memorable Mathematics|year=2007|publisher=MAA}}:143</ref> Leibniz subsequently left Leipzig.<ref>Mackie (1845), 38</ref>\n\nLeibniz then enrolled in the [[University of Altdorf]] and quickly submitted a thesis, which he had probably been working on earlier in Leipzig.<ref>Mackie (1845), 39</ref> The title of his thesis was ''Disputatio Inauguralis de Casibus Perplexis in Jure'' (''Inaugural Disputation on Ambiguous Legal Cases'').<ref name=\"Arthur p. x\"/> Leibniz earned his license to practice law and his Doctorate in Law in November 1666. He next declined the offer of an academic appointment at Altdorf, saying that \"my thoughts were turned in an entirely different direction\".<ref>Mackie (1845), 40</ref>\n\nAs an adult, Leibniz often introduced himself as \"Gottfried [[von]] Leibniz\". Many posthumously published editions of his writings presented his name on the title page as \"[[Freiherr]] G. W. von Leibniz.\" However, no document has ever been found from any contemporary government that stated his appointment to any form of [[nobility]].<ref>Aiton 1985: 312</ref>\n\n===1666–1674<!--linked from the lead section-->===\n[[File:Gottfried-Wilhelm-Leibniz-Louis-Dutens-opera-omnia MG 1180.tif|thumb|Engraving of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]Leibniz's first position was as a salaried secretary to an [[alchemy|alchemical]] society in [[Nuremberg]].<ref>Ariew R., G.W.

[https://books.google.com/books?id=SnRis5Gdi8gC&pg=PA21 Extract of page 21]</ref> He knew fairly little about the subject at that time but presented himself as deeply learned. He soon met [[Johann Christian von Boyneburg]] (1622–1672), the dismissed chief minister of the Elector of [[Mainz]], [[Johann Philipp von Schönborn]].<ref>Mackie (1845), 43</ref> Von Boyneburg hired Leibniz as an assistant, and shortly thereafter reconciled with the Elector and introduced Leibniz to him. Leibniz then dedicated an essay on law to the Elector in the hope of obtaining employment. The stratagem worked; the Elector asked Leibniz to assist with the redrafting of the legal code for the Electorate.<ref>Mackie (1845), 44–45</ref> In 1669, Leibniz was appointed assessor in the Court of Appeal. Although von Boyneburg died late in 1672, Leibniz remained under the employment of his widow until she dismissed him in 1674.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nVon Boyneburg did much to promote Leibniz's reputation, and the latter's memoranda and letters began to attract favorable notice. After Leibniz's service to the Elector there soon followed a [[diplomat]]ic role. He published an essay, under the pseudonym of a fictitious [[Poland|Polish]] nobleman, arguing (unsuccessfully) for the German candidate for the Polish crown. The main force in [[Europe]]an geopolitics during Leibniz's adult life was the ambition of [[Louis XIV of France]], backed by French military and economic might. Meanwhile, the [[Thirty Years' War]] had left [[German language in Europe|German-speaking Europe]] exhausted, fragmented, and economically backward. Leibniz proposed to protect German-speaking Europe by distracting Louis as follows. France would be invited to take [[Egypt]] as a stepping stone towards an eventual conquest of the [[Dutch East Indies]]. In return, France would agree to leave Germany and the Netherlands undisturbed. This plan obtained the Elector's cautious support. In 1672, the French government invited Leibniz to [[Paris]] for discussion,<ref>Mackie (1845), 58–61</ref> but the plan was soon overtaken by the outbreak of the [[Franco-Dutch War]] and became irrelevant. Napoleon's [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|failed invasion of Egypt in 1798]] can be seen as an unwitting, late implementation of Leibniz's plan, after the Eastern hemisphere colonial supremacy in Europe had already passed from the Dutch to the British.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nThus Leibniz began several years in Paris. Soon after arriving, he met [[Netherlands|Dutch]] physicist and mathematician [[Christiaan Huygens]] and realised that his own knowledge of mathematics and physics was patchy. With Huygens as his mentor, he began a program of [[self-study]] that soon pushed him to making major contributions to both subjects, including discovering his version of the differential and integral [[calculus]]. He met [[Nicolas Malebranche]] and [[Antoine Arnauld]], the leading French philosophers of the day, and studied the writings of [[Descartes]] and [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]], unpublished as well as published. He befriended a German mathematician, [[Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus]]; they corresponded for the rest of their lives. In 1675 he would be admitted by the [[French Academy of Sciences]] as a foreign honorary member, despite his lack of attention to the academy.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\n[[File:Leibnitzrechenmaschine.jpg|thumb|[[Stepped reckoner]]]]\n\nWhen it became clear that France would not implement its part of Leibniz's Egyptian plan, the Elector sent his nephew, escorted by Leibniz, on a related mission to the English government in [[London]], early in 1673.<ref>Mackie (1845), 69–70</ref> There Leibniz came into acquaintance of [[Henry Oldenburg]] and [[John Collins (mathematician)|John Collins]]. He met with the [[Royal Society]] where he demonstrated a calculating machine that he had designed and had been building since 1670. The machine was able to execute all four basic operations (adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing), and the society quickly made him an external member.\n\nThe mission ended abruptly when news of the Elector's death (12 February 1673) reached them. Leibniz promptly returned to Paris and not, as had been planned, to Mainz.<ref>Mackie (1845), 73–74</ref> The sudden deaths of his two patrons in the same winter meant that Leibniz had to find a new basis for his career.\n\nIn this regard, a 1669 invitation from the [[John Frederick, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg|John Frederick]] of [[Brunswick-Lüneburg|Brunswick]] to visit Hanover proved to have been fateful. Leibniz had declined the invitation, but had begun corresponding with the duke in 1671. In 1673, the duke offered Leibniz the post of counsellor. Leibniz very reluctantly accepted the position two years later, only after it became clear that no employment in Paris, whose intellectual stimulation he relished, or with the [[Habsburg]] imperial court, was forthcoming.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\n===House of Hanover, 1676–1716===\n{{Refimprove section|date=January 2014}}\nLeibniz managed to delay his arrival in Hanover until the end of 1676 after making one more short journey to London, where Newton accused him of having seen Newton's unpublished work on calculus in advance.<ref>On the encounter between Newton and Leibniz and a review of the evidence, see Alfred Rupert Hall, ''Philosophers at War: The Quarrel Between Newton and Leibniz'', (Cambridge, 2002), pp. 44–69.</ref>  This was alleged to be evidence supporting the accusation, made decades later, that he had stolen calculus from Newton. On the journey from London to Hanover, Leibniz stopped in [[The Hague]] where he met [[van Leeuwenhoek]], the discoverer of microorganisms. He also spent several days in intense discussion with [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]], who had just completed his masterwork, the ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]''.<ref>Mackie (1845), 117–118</ref>\n\nIn 1677, he was promoted, at his request, to Privy Counselor of Justice, a post he held for the rest of his life. Leibniz served three consecutive rulers of the House of Brunswick as historian, political adviser, and most consequentially, as librarian of the [[duke|ducal]] library. He thenceforth employed his pen on all the various political, historical, and [[theological]] matters involving the House of Brunswick; the resulting documents form a valuable part of the historical record for the period.\n\nAmong the few people in north Germany to accept Leibniz were the Electress [[Sophia of Hanover]] (1630–1714), her daughter [[Sophia Charlotte of Hanover]] (1668–1705), the Queen of Prussia and his avowed disciple, and [[Caroline of Ansbach]], the consort of her grandson, the future [[George II of Great Britain|George II]]. To each of these women he was correspondent, adviser, and friend. In turn, they all approved of Leibniz more than did their spouses and the future king [[George I of Great Britain]].<ref>For a study of Leibniz's correspondence with Sophia Charlotte, see MacDonald Ross, George, 1990, \"Leibniz’s Exposition of His System to Queen Sophie Charlotte and Other Ladies.\" In ''Leibniz in Berlin'', ed. H. Poser and A. Heinekamp, Stuttgart: Franz Steiner, 1990, 61–69.</ref>\n\nThe population of Hanover was only about 10,000, and its provinciality eventually grated on Leibniz. Nevertheless, to be a major courtier to the House of [[Brunswick-Lüneburg|Brunswick]] was quite an honor, especially in light of the meteoric rise in the prestige of that House during Leibniz's association with it. In 1692, the Duke of Brunswick became a hereditary Elector of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The British [[Act of Settlement 1701]] designated the Electress Sophia and her descent as the royal family of England, once both King [[William III of England|William III]] and his sister-in-law and successor, [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]], were dead. Leibniz played a role in the initiatives and negotiations leading up to that Act, but not always an effective one. For example, something he published anonymously in England, thinking to promote the Brunswick cause, was formally censured by the [[British Parliament]].\n\nThe Brunswicks tolerated the enormous effort Leibniz devoted to intellectual pursuits unrelated to his duties as a courtier, pursuits such as perfecting calculus, writing about other mathematics, logic, physics, and philosophy, and keeping up a vast correspondence. He began working on calculus in 1674; the earliest evidence of its use in his surviving notebooks is 1675. By 1677 he had a coherent system in hand, but did not publish it until 1684. Leibniz's most important mathematical papers were published between 1682 and 1692, usually in a journal which he and Otto Mencke founded in 1682, the ''[[Acta Eruditorum]]''. That journal played a key role in advancing his mathematical and scientific reputation, which in turn enhanced his eminence in diplomacy, history, theology, and philosophy.\n\n[[File:Korespondencja Gottfrieda Leibniza.jpg|thumb|250px|Leibniz's correspondence, papers and notes from 1669–1704, [[National Library of Poland]].]]\n\nThe Elector [[Ernest Augustus, Elector of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Ernest Augustus]] commissioned Leibniz to write a history of the House of Brunswick, going back to the time of [[Charlemagne]] or earlier, hoping that the resulting book would advance his dynastic ambitions. From 1687 to 1690, Leibniz traveled extensively in Germany, Austria, and Italy, seeking and finding archival materials bearing on this project. Decades went by but no history appeared; the next Elector became quite annoyed at Leibniz's apparent dilatoriness. Leibniz never finished the project, in part because of his huge output on many other fronts, but also because he insisted on writing a meticulously researched and erudite book based on archival sources, when his patrons would have been quite happy with a short popular book, one perhaps little more than a [[genealogy]] with commentary, to be completed in three years or less. They never knew that he had in fact carried out a fair part of his assigned task: when the material Leibniz had written and collected for his history of the House of Brunswick was finally published in the 19th century, it filled three volumes.\n\nIn 1708, [[John Keill]], writing in the journal of the Royal Society and with Newton's presumed blessing, accused Leibniz of having plagiarised Newton's calculus.<ref>Mackie (1845), 109</ref> Thus began the [[Newton v. Leibniz calculus controversy|calculus priority dispute]] which darkened the remainder of Leibniz's life. A formal investigation by the Royal Society (in which Newton was an unacknowledged participant), undertaken in response to Leibniz's demand for a retraction, upheld Keill's charge. Historians of mathematics writing since 1900 or so have tended to acquit Leibniz, pointing to important differences between Leibniz's and Newton's versions of calculus.\n\nIn 1711, while traveling in northern Europe, the Russian [[Tsar]] [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] stopped in Hanover and met Leibniz, who then took some interest in Russian matters for the rest of his life. In 1712, Leibniz began a two-year residence in [[Vienna]], where he was appointed Imperial Court Councillor to the [[Habsburg]]s. On the death of Queen Anne in 1714, Elector George Louis became King [[George I of Great Britain]], under the terms of the 1701 Act of Settlement. Even though Leibniz had done much to bring about this happy event, it was not to be his hour of glory. Despite the intercession of the Princess of Wales, Caroline of Ansbach, George I forbade Leibniz to join him in London until he completed at least one volume of the history of the Brunswick family his father had commissioned nearly 30 years earlier. Moreover, for George I to include Leibniz in his London court would have been deemed insulting to Newton, who was seen as having won the calculus priority dispute and whose standing in British official circles could not have been higher. Finally, his dear friend and defender, the Dowager Electress Sophia, died in 1714.\n\n==Death==\n\nLeibniz died in [[Hanover]] in 1716: at the time, he was so out of favor that neither George I (who happened to be near Hanover at that time) nor any fellow courtier other than his personal secretary attended the funeral. Even though Leibniz was a life member of the Royal Society and the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy of Sciences]], neither organization saw fit to honor his passing. His grave went unmarked for more than 50 years. Leibniz was eulogized by [[Bernard de Fontenelle|Fontenelle]], before the [[Academie des Sciences]] in [[Paris]], which had admitted him as a foreign member in 1700. The eulogy was composed at the behest of the [[Elizabeth Charlotte, Princess Palatine|Duchess of Orleans]], a niece of the Electress Sophia.\n\n==Personal life==\nLeibniz never married. He complained on occasion about money, but the fair sum he left to his sole heir, his sister's stepson, proved that the Brunswicks had, by and large, paid him well. In his diplomatic endeavors, he at times verged on the unscrupulous, as was all too often the case with professional diplomats of his day. On several occasions, Leibniz backdated and altered personal manuscripts, actions which put him in a bad light during the [[Newton v. Leibniz calculus controversy|calculus controversy]]. On the other hand, he was charming, well-mannered, and not without humor and imagination.<ref>See Wiener IV.6 and Loemker §40.

Dent & Sons Ltd.</ref> He had many friends and admirers all over Europe. On Leibniz's religious views, although he is considered by some biographers as a [[deist]], he has also been claimed as a [[philosophical theism|philosophical theist]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Christian Mathematicians – Leibniz – GOD & MATH – Thinking Christianly About Math Education|url=http://godandmath.com/2012/01/30/christian-mathematicians-leibniz/}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Discourse on Metaphysics and Other Writings|year=2012|publisher=Broadview Press|isbn=9781554810116|pages=23–24|author=Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|editor=Peter Loptson|quote=The answer is unknowable, but it may not be unreasonable to see him, at least in theological terms, as essentially a deist.

According to their doctrine, God Almighty wants to wind up his watch from time to time; otherwise it would cease to move.\" (Leibniz 1715, 675) Leibniz argues that any scientific theory that relies on God to perform miracles after He had first made the universe indicates that God lacked sufficient foresight or power to establish adequate natural laws in the first place. In defense of Newton's theism, Clarke is unapologetic: \"'tis not a diminution but the true glory of his workmanship that nothing is done without his continual government and inspection\"' (Leibniz 1715, 676–677). Clarke is believed to have consulted closely with Newton on how to respond to Leibniz. He asserts that Leibniz's deism leads to \"the notion of materialism and fate\" (1715, 677), because it excludes God from the daily workings of nature.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Controversy in Marketing Theory: For Reason, Realism, Truth, and Objectivity|year=2003|publisher=M.E.

He wrote only two book-length philosophical treatises, of which only the ''Théodicée'' of 1710 was published in his lifetime.\n\nLeibniz dated his beginning as a philosopher to his ''[[Discourse on Metaphysics]]'', which he composed in 1686 as a commentary on a running dispute between [[Nicolas Malebranche]] and [[Antoine Arnauld]]. This led to an extensive and valuable correspondence with Arnauld;<ref>Ariew & Garber, 69; Loemker, §§36, 38</ref> it and the ''Discourse'' were not published until the 19th century. In 1695, Leibniz made his public entrée into European philosophy with a journal article titled \"New System of the Nature and Communication of Substances\".<ref>Ariew & Garber, 138; Loemker, §47; Wiener, II.4</ref> Between 1695 and 1705, he composed his ''[[New Essays on Human Understanding]]'', a lengthy commentary on [[John Locke]]'s 1690 ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'', but upon learning of Locke's 1704 death, lost the desire to publish it, so that the ''New Essays'' were not published until 1765. The ''[[Monadology|Monadologie]]'', composed in 1714 and published posthumously, consists of 90 aphorisms.\n\nLeibniz met [[Spinoza]] in 1676, read some of his unpublished writings, and has since been suspected of appropriating some of Spinoza's ideas. While Leibniz admired Spinoza's powerful intellect, he was also forthrightly dismayed by Spinoza's conclusions,<ref>Ariew & Garber, 272–84; Loemker, §§14, 20, 21; Wiener, III.8</ref> especially when these were inconsistent with Christian orthodoxy.\n\nUnlike Descartes and Spinoza, Leibniz had a thorough university education in philosophy. He was influenced by his [[Leipzig]] professor [[Jakob Thomasius]], who also supervised his BA thesis in philosophy.<ref name=\"Arthur p. 13\">Arthur 2014, p. 13.</ref> Leibniz also eagerly read [[Francisco Suárez]], a Spanish [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] respected even in [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] universities. Leibniz was deeply interested in the new methods and conclusions of Descartes, Huygens, Newton, and [[Robert Boyle|Boyle]], but viewed their work through a lens heavily tinted by scholastic notions. Yet it remains the case that Leibniz's methods and concerns often anticipate the [[logic]], and [[analytic philosophy|analytic]] and [[linguistic philosophy]] of the 20th century.\n\n===The Principles===<!--Linked from \"Difference (philosophy)\"-->\nLeibniz variously invoked one or another of seven fundamental philosophical Principles:<ref>Mates (1986), chpts. 7.3, 9</ref>\n* [[Identity (mathematics)|Identity]]/[[contradiction]]. If a proposition is true, then its negation is false and vice versa.\n* [[Identity of indiscernibles]]. Two distinct things cannot have all their properties in common. If every predicate possessed by x is also possessed by y and vice versa, then entities x and y are identical;  to suppose two things indiscernible is to suppose the same thing under two names. Frequently invoked in modern logic and philosophy, the \"identity of indiscernibles\" is often referred to as Leibniz's Law. It has attracted the most controversy and criticism, especially from corpuscular philosophy and quantum mechanics.\n* [[principle of sufficient reason|Sufficient reason]]. \"There must be a sufficient reason for anything to exist, for any event to occur, for any truth to obtain.\"<ref>Loemker 717</ref>\n* [[Pre-established harmony]].<ref>See Jolley (1995: 129–31), Woolhouse and Francks (1998), and Mercer (2001).</ref> \"[T]he appropriate nature of each substance brings it about that what happens to one corresponds to what happens to all the others, without, however, their acting upon one another directly.\" (''Discourse on Metaphysics'', XIV) A dropped glass shatters because it \"knows\" it has hit the ground, and not because the impact with the ground \"compels\" the glass to split.\n* [[Law of Continuity]].

For a classic discussion of Sufficient Reason and Plenitude, see Lovejoy (1957).</ref>\n\n===The monads===\nLeibniz's best known contribution to [[metaphysics]] is his theory of [[Monad (philosophy)|monads]], as exposited in ''[[Monadology|Monadologie]]''. According to Leibniz, monads are [[elementary particles]] with blurred perceptions of one another.  Monads can also be compared to the corpuscles of the [[Mechanical Philosophy]] of René Descartes and others. Monads are the ultimate elements of the [[universe]]. The monads are \"substantial forms of being\" with the following properties: they are eternal, indecomposable, individual, subject to their own laws, un-interacting, and each reflecting the entire universe in a [[pre-established harmony]] (a historically important example of [[panpsychism]]). Monads are centers of [[force]]; substance is force, while [[space]], [[matter]], and [[Motion (physics)|motion]] are merely phenomenal.\n\nThe [[ontology|ontological]] essence of a monad is its irreducible simplicity. Unlike atoms, monads possess no material or spatial character. They also differ from atoms by their complete mutual independence, so that interactions among monads are only apparent. Instead, by virtue of the principle of pre-established harmony, each monad follows a preprogrammed set of \"instructions\" peculiar to itself, so that a monad \"knows\" what to do at each moment. By virtue of these intrinsic instructions, each monad is like a little mirror of the universe. Monads need not be \"small\"; e.g., each human being constitutes a monad, in which case [[free will]] is problematic.\n\nMonads are purported to have gotten rid of the problematic:\n* interaction between [[mind]] and matter arising in the system of [[Descartes]];\n* lack of [[Principle of individuation|individuation]] inherent to the system of [[Spinoza]], which represents individual creatures as merely accidental.\n\n===Theodicy and optimism===\n{{further information|Best of all possible worlds}}\nThe word \"optimism\" is used in the classic sense of optimal, not optimistic.\n\nThe ''[[Théodicée|Theodicy]]''<ref>Rutherford (1998) is a detailed scholarly study of Leibniz's [[theodicy]].</ref> tries to justify the apparent imperfections of the world by claiming that it is [[Best of all possible worlds|optimal among all possible worlds]]. It must be the best possible and most balanced world, because it was created by an all powerful and all knowing God, who would not choose to create an imperfect world if a better world could be known to him or possible to exist. In effect, apparent flaws that can be identified in this world must exist in every possible world, because otherwise God would have chosen to create the world that excluded those flaws.\n\nLeibniz asserted that the truths of theology (religion) and philosophy cannot contradict each other, since reason and faith are both \"gifts of God\" so that their conflict would imply God contending against himself. The ''Theodicy'' is Leibniz's attempt to reconcile his personal philosophical system with his interpretation of the tenets of Christianity.<ref>Magill, Frank (ed.). ''Masterpieces of World Philosophy''. New York: Harper Collins (1990).</ref> This project was motivated in part by Leibniz's belief, shared by many conservative philosophers and theologians during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], in the rational and enlightened nature of the Christian religion as compared to its purportedly less advanced non-Western counterparts. It was also shaped by Leibniz's belief in the perfectibility of human nature (if humanity relied on correct philosophy and religion as a guide), and by his belief that metaphysical necessity must have a rational or logical foundation, even if this metaphysical causality seemed inexplicable in terms of physical necessity (the natural laws identified by science).\n\nBecause reason and faith must be entirely reconciled, any tenet of faith which could not be defended by reason must be rejected. Leibniz then approached one of the central criticisms of Christian theism:<ref>Magill, Frank (ed.) (1990)</ref> if God is [[Omnibenevolent|all good]], [[Omniscience|all wise]] and [[Omnipotent|all powerful]], how did [[Problem of evil|evil come into the world]]? The answer (according to Leibniz) is that, while God is indeed unlimited in wisdom and power, his human creations, as creations, are limited both in their wisdom and in their will (power to act). This predisposes humans to false beliefs, wrong decisions and ineffective actions in the exercise of their [[free will]]. God does not arbitrarily inflict pain and suffering on humans; rather he permits both ''moral evil'' (sin) and ''physical evil'' (pain and suffering) as the necessary consequences of ''metaphysical evil'' (imperfection), as a means by which humans can identify and correct their erroneous decisions, and as a contrast to true good.\n\nFurther, although human actions flow from prior causes that ultimately arise in God, and therefore are known as a metaphysical certainty to God, an individual's free will is exercised within natural laws, where choices are merely contingently necessary, to be decided in the event by a \"wonderful spontaneity\" that provides individuals an escape from rigorous predestination.\n\n=== Discourse on Metaphysics ===\n'''''On God (I–VI)'''''\n\nFor Leibniz, “God is an absolutely perfect being.”&nbsp; He describes this perfection later in section VI as the simplest form of something with the most substantial outcome (VI).&nbsp; Along these lines, he declares that every type of perfection “pertains to him (God) in the highest degree” (I).&nbsp; Even though his types of perfections are not specifically drawn out, Leibniz highlights the one thing that, to him, does certify imperfections and proves that God is perfect: “that one acts imperfectly if he acts with less perfection than he is capable of,” and since God is a perfect being, he cannot act imperfectly (III).&nbsp; Because God cannot act imperfectly, the decisions he makes pertaining to the world must be perfect. Leibniz also comforts readers, stating that because he has done everything to the most perfect degree; those who love him cannot be injured.&nbsp; However, to love God is a subject of difficulty as Leibniz believes that we are “not disposed to wish for that which God desires” because we have the ability to alter our disposition (IV). In accordance with this, many act as rebels, but Leibniz says that the only way we can truly love God is by being content “with all that comes to us according to his will” (IV).\n\nBecause God is “an absolutely perfect being” (I), Leibniz argues that God would be acting imperfectly if he acted with any less perfection than what he is able of (III).&nbsp;His syllogism then ends with the statement that God has made the world perfectly in all ways.&nbsp; This also effects how we should view God and his will. Leibniz states that, in lieu of God’s will, we have to understand that God “is the best of all masters” and he will know when his good succeeds, so we, therefore, must act in conformity to his good will – or as much of it as we understand (IV). In our view of God, Leibniz declares that we cannot admire the work solely because of the maker, lest we mar the glory and love God in doing so.&nbsp; Instead, we must admire the maker for the work he has done (II). &nbsp;Effectively, Leibniz states that if we say the earth is good because of the will of God, and not good according to some standards of goodness, then how can we praise God for what he has done if contrary actions are also praiseworthy by this definition (II).&nbsp; Leibniz then asserts that different principles and geometry cannot simply be from the will of God, but must follow from his understanding.<ref>Leibniz, Gottfried Wilhelm. ''Discourse on Metaphysics. The Rationalists: Rene Descartes-Discourse on Method, Meditations''. N.Y.: Dolphin., n.d. N. pag. Print.</ref>\n\n===Symbolic thought===\nLeibniz believed that much of human reasoning could be reduced to calculations of a sort, and that such calculations could resolve many differences of opinion:\n\n<blockquote>The only way to rectify our reasonings is to make them as tangible as those of the Mathematicians, so that we can find our error at a glance, and when there are disputes among persons, we can simply say: Let us calculate [''calculemus''], without further ado, to see who is right.<ref>''The Art of Discovery'' 1685, Wiener 51</ref></blockquote>\n\nLeibniz's [[calculus ratiocinator]], which resembles [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]], can be viewed as a way of making such calculations feasible. Leibniz wrote memoranda<ref>Many of his memoranda are translated in Parkinson 1966.</ref> that can now be read as groping attempts to get symbolic logic—and thus his ''calculus''—off the ground. But Gerhard and Couturat did not publish these writings until modern formal logic had emerged in [[Gottlob Frege|Frege's]] ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'' and in writings by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and his students in the 1880s, and hence well after [[George Boole|Boole]] and [[Augustus De Morgan|De Morgan]] began that logic in 1847.\n\nLeibniz thought [[symbol]]s were important for human understanding. He attached so much importance to the development of good notations that he attributed all his discoveries in mathematics to this. His notation for [[calculus]] is an example of his skill in this regard. C.S. Peirce, a 19th-century pioneer of [[semiotics]], shared Leibniz's passion for symbols and notation, and his belief that these are essential to a well-running logic and mathematics.\n\nBut Leibniz took his speculations much further. Defining a [[Grapheme|character]] as any written sign, he then defined a \"real\" character as one that represents an idea directly and not simply as the word embodying the idea. Some real characters, such as the notation of logic, serve only to facilitate reasoning. Many characters well known in his day, including [[Egyptian hieroglyphics]], [[Chinese character]]s, and the symbols of [[astronomy]] and [[chemistry]], he deemed not real.<ref>Loemker, however, who translated some of Leibniz's works into English, said that the symbols of chemistry were real characters, so there is disagreement among Leibniz scholars on this point.</ref><!--is this paragraph correct up to this point?--> Instead, he proposed the creation of a ''[[characteristica universalis]]'' or \"universal characteristic\", built on an [[alphabet of human thought]] in which each fundamental concept would be represented by a unique \"real\" character:\n\n<blockquote>It is obvious that if we could find characters or signs suited for expressing all our thoughts as clearly and as exactly as arithmetic expresses numbers or geometry expresses lines, we could do in all matters ''insofar as they are subject to reasoning'' all that we can do in arithmetic and geometry. For all investigations which depend on reasoning would be carried out by transposing these characters and by a species of calculus.<ref>''Preface to the General Science'', 1677. Revision of Rutherford's translation in Jolley 1995: 234. Also Wiener I.4</ref></blockquote>\n\nComplex thoughts would be represented by combining characters for simpler thoughts. Leibniz saw that the uniqueness of [[prime factorization]] suggests a central role for [[prime numbers]] in the universal characteristic, a striking anticipation of [[Gödel numbering]]. Granted, there is no intuitive or [[mnemonic]] way to number any set of elementary concepts using the prime numbers. Leibniz's idea of reasoning through a universal language of symbols and calculations however remarkably foreshadows great 20th century developments in formal systems, such as [[Turing completeness]], where computation was used to define equivalent universal languages (see [[Turing degree]]).\n\nBecause Leibniz was a mathematical novice when he first wrote about the ''characteristic'', at first he did not conceive it as an [[algebra]] but rather as a [[universal characteristic|universal language]] or script. Only in 1676 did he conceive of a kind of \"algebra of thought\", modeled on and including conventional algebra and its notation. The resulting ''characteristic'' included a logical calculus, some combinatorics, algebra, his ''analysis situs'' (geometry of situation), a universal concept language, and more.\n\nWhat Leibniz actually intended by his ''characteristica universalis'' and calculus ratiocinator, and the extent to which modern formal logic does justice to calculus, may never be established.<ref>A good introductory discussion of the \"characteristic\" is Jolley (1995: 226–40). An early, yet still classic, discussion of the \"characteristic\" and \"calculus\" is Couturat (1901: chpts. 3,4).</ref>\n\n===Formal logic===\n{{Main article|Algebraic logic}}\nLeibniz is one of the most important logicians between Aristotle and 1847, when [[George Boole]] and [[Augustus De Morgan]] each published books that began modern formal logic. Leibniz enunciated the principal properties of what we now call [[logical conjunction|conjunction]], [[disjunction]], [[negation]], [[Identity (mathematics)|identity]], set [[subset|inclusion]], and the [[empty set]]. The principles of Leibniz's logic and, arguably, of his whole philosophy, reduce to two:\n\n# All our ideas are compounded from a very small number of simple ideas, which form the [[alphabet of human thought]].\n# Complex ideas proceed from these simple ideas by a uniform and symmetrical combination, analogous to arithmetical multiplication.\n\nThe formal logic that emerged early in the 20th century also requires, at minimum, unary negation and [[Quantification (logic)|quantified]] [[variable (mathematics)|variables]] ranging over some [[universe of discourse]].\n\nLeibniz published nothing on formal logic in his lifetime; most of what he wrote on the subject consists of working drafts. In his book ''[[History of Western Philosophy (Russell)|History of Western Philosophy]]'', [[Bertrand Russell]] went so far as to claim that Leibniz had developed logic in his unpublished writings to a level which was reached only 200 years later.\n\n==Mathematician==\nAlthough the mathematical notion of [[Function (mathematics)|function]] was implicit in trigonometric and logarithmic tables, which existed in his day, Leibniz was the first, in 1692 and 1694, to employ it explicitly, to denote any of several geometric concepts derived from a curve, such as [[abscissa]], [[ordinate]], [[tangent]], [[chord (geometry)|chord]], and the [[Normal (geometry)|perpendicular]].<ref>Struik (1969), 367</ref> In the 18th century, \"function\" lost these geometrical associations.\n\nLeibniz was the first to see that the coefficients of a system of [[linear equation]]s could be arranged into an array, now called a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], which can be manipulated to find the solution of the system, if any. This method was later called [[Gaussian elimination]]. Leibniz's discoveries of [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] and of [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]], also relevant to mathematics, are discussed in the preceding section. The best overview of Leibniz's writings on calculus may be found in Bos (1974).<ref name=\"Douglas M. Jesseph, 1998\">{{cite journal|last=Jesseph|first=Douglas M.|title=Leibniz on the Foundations of the Calculus: The Question of the Reality of Infinitesimal Magnitudes|journal=[[Perspectives on Science]]|year=1998|volume=6.1&2|pages=6–40|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/perspectives_on_science/v006/6.1jesseph.html|accessdate=31 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Calculus===\nLeibniz is credited, along with Sir [[Isaac Newton]], with the discovery of [[calculus]] (differential and integral calculus). According to Leibniz's notebooks, a critical breakthrough occurred on November 11, 1675, when he employed integral calculus for the first time to find the area under the graph of a function ''y''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''ƒ''(''x'').<ref name=\"Leibniz1920\">{{cite book|last1=Leibniz|first1=Gottfried Wilhelm Freiherr von|last2=Gerhardt|first2=Carl Immanuel (trans.)|title=The Early Mathematical Manuscripts of Leibniz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QG_QAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA93|accessdate=10 November 2013|year=1920|publisher=Open Court Publishing|page=93}}</ref> He introduced several notations used to this day, for instance the [[integral sign]] ∫ representing an elongated S, from the Latin word ''summa'' and the ''d'' used for [[Differential (infinitesimal)|differentials]], from the Latin word ''differentia''. This cleverly suggestive notation for calculus is probably his most enduring mathematical legacy. Leibniz did not publish anything about his calculus until 1684.<ref>For an English translation of this paper, see Struik (1969: 271–84), who also translates parts of two other key papers by Leibniz on calculus.</ref> The [[product rule]] of [[differential calculus]] is still called \"Leibniz's law\". In addition, the theorem that tells how and when to differentiate under the integral sign is called the [[Leibniz integral rule]].\n\nLeibniz exploited [[infinitesimal]]s in developing calculus, manipulating them in ways suggesting that they had [[paradox]]ical [[algebra]]ic properties. [[George Berkeley]], in a tract called ''[[The Analyst]]'' and also in ''De Motu'', criticized these.  A recent study argues that Leibnizian calculus was free of contradictions, and was better grounded than Berkeley's empiricist criticisms.<ref>{{citation\n | last1 = Katz | first1 = Mikhail\n | author1-link = Mikhail Katz\n | last2 = Sherry | first2 = David\n | author2-link =\n | arxiv = 1205.0174\n | doi = 10.1007/s10670-012-9370-y\n | issue =\n | journal = [[Erkenntnis]]\n | pages =\n | title = Leibniz's Infinitesimals: Their Fictionality, Their Modern Implementations, and Their Foes from Berkeley to Russell and Beyond\n | volume =\n | year = 2012}}</ref>\n   \nFrom 1711 until his death, Leibniz was engaged in a dispute with John Keill, Newton and others, over whether Leibniz had invented calculus independently of Newton. This subject is treated at length in the article [[Leibniz-Newton controversy]].\n\nThe use of infinitesimals in mathematics was frowned upon by followers of [[Karl Weierstrass]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}, but survived in science and engineering, and even in rigorous mathematics, via the fundamental computational device known as the [[Differential (infinitesimal)|differential]]. Beginning in 1960, [[Abraham Robinson]] worked out a rigorous foundation for Leibniz's infinitesimals, using [[model theory]], in the context of a field of [[hyperreal number]]s. The resulting [[non-standard analysis]] can be seen as a belated vindication of Leibniz's mathematical reasoning.  Robinson's [[transfer principle]] is a mathematical implementation of Leibniz's heuristic [[law of continuity]], while the [[standard part function]] implements the Leibnizian [[transcendental law of homogeneity]].\n\n===Topology===\nLeibniz was the first to use the term ''analysis situs'',<ref>Loemker §27</ref> later used in the 19th century to refer to what is now known as [[topology]]. There are two takes on this situation. On the one hand, Mates, citing a 1954 paper in German by [[Jacob Freudenthal]], argues:\n\n<blockquote>Although for Leibniz the situs of a sequence of points is completely determined by the distance between them and is altered if those distances are altered, his admirer [[Euler]], in the famous 1736 paper solving the [[Seven Bridges of Königsberg|Königsberg Bridge Problem]] and its generalizations, used the term ''geometria situs'' in such a sense that the situs remains unchanged under topological deformations. He mistakenly credits Leibniz with originating this concept. ...it is sometimes not realized that Leibniz used the term in an entirely different sense and hence can hardly be considered the founder of that part of mathematics.<ref>Mates (1986), 240</ref></blockquote>\n\nBut Hideaki Hirano argues differently, quoting [[Benoit Mandelbrot|Mandelbrot]]:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.t.hosei.ac.jp/~hhirano/academia/leibniz.htm |title=Leibniz's Cultural Pluralism And Natural Law |last=Hirano |first=Hideaki |accessdate=March 10, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522130455/http://www.t.hosei.ac.jp/~hhirano/academia/leibniz.htm |archivedate=22 May 2009 }}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>To sample Leibniz' scientific works is a sobering experience. Next to calculus, and to other thoughts that have been carried out to completion, the number and variety of premonitory thrusts is overwhelming. We saw examples in 'packing,'...&nbsp;My Leibniz mania is further reinforced by finding that for one moment its hero attached importance to geometric scaling. In \"Euclidis Prota\"..., which is an attempt to tighten Euclid's axioms, he states,...: 'I have diverse definitions for the straight line. The straight line is a curve, any part of which is similar to the whole, and it alone has this property, not only among curves but among sets.' This claim can be proved today.<ref>Mandelbrot (1977), 419. Quoted in Hirano (1997).</ref></blockquote>\n\nThus the [[fractal|fractal geometry]] promoted by Mandelbrot drew on Leibniz's notions of [[self-similarity]] and the principle of continuity: ''[[Natura non facit saltus]]''.<ref name=\"Saltus\"/> We also see that when Leibniz wrote, in a metaphysical vein, that \"the straight line is a curve, any part of which is similar to the whole\", he was anticipating topology by more than two centuries. As for \"packing\", Leibniz told to his friend and correspondent Des Bosses to imagine a circle, then to inscribe within it three congruent circles with maximum radius; the latter smaller circles could be filled with three even smaller circles by the same procedure. This process can be continued infinitely, from which arises a good idea of self-similarity. Leibniz's improvement of Euclid's axiom contains the same concept.\n\n== Scientist and engineer ==\nLeibniz's writings are currently discussed, not only for their anticipations and possible discoveries not yet recognized, but as ways of advancing present knowledge. Much of his writing on physics is included in Gerhardt's ''Mathematical Writings''.\n\n===Physics===\n{{See also|Dynamism (metaphysics)|Conatus#In Leibniz}}\nLeibniz contributed a fair amount to the statics and dynamics emerging around him, often disagreeing with [[Descartes]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]. He devised a new theory of [[Motion (physics)|motion]] ([[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]]) based on [[kinetic energy]] and [[potential energy]], which posited space as relative, whereas Newton was thoroughly convinced that space was absolute. An important example of Leibniz's mature physical thinking is his ''Specimen Dynamicum'' of 1695.<ref>Ariew and Garber 117, Loemker §46, W II.5. On Leibniz and physics, see the chapter by Garber in Jolley (1995) and Wilson (1989).</ref>\n\nUntil the discovery of subatomic particles and the [[quantum mechanics]] governing them, many of Leibniz's speculative ideas about aspects of nature not reducible to statics and dynamics made little sense. For instance, he anticipated [[Albert Einstein]] by arguing, against Newton, that [[space]], [[time]] and motion are relative, not absolute: \"As for my own opinion, I have said more than once, that I hold space to be something merely relative, as time is, that I hold it to be an order of coexistences, as time is an order of successions.\"<ref>See H. G. Alexander, ed., ''The [[Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence]]'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, pp. 25–26.</ref>\n\nLeibniz's [[Relational theory|relationist]] notion of space and time as against Newton's substantivalist views.<ref>Futch, Michael.  ''Leibniz’s Metaphysics of Time and Space''. New York: Springer, 2008.</ref><ref>Ray, Christopher. ''Time, Space and Philosophy''. London: Routledge, 1991.</ref><ref>Rickles, Dean. ''Symmetry, Structure and Spacetime''. Oxford: Elsevier, 2008.</ref> According to Newton's substantivalism, space and time are entities in their own right, existing independently of things. Leibniz's relationism, on the other hand, describes [[space and time]] as systems of relations that exist between objects. The rise of [[general relativity]] and subsequent work in the [[history of physics]] has put Leibniz's stance in a more favorable light.\n\nOne of Leibniz's projects was to recast Newton's theory as a [[Mechanical explanations of gravitation|vortex theory]].<ref name=\"Arthur p. 56\">Arthur 2014, p. 56.</ref> However, his project went beyond vortex theory, since at its heart there was an attempt to explain one of the most difficult problems in physics, that of the origin of the [[Cohesion (chemistry)|cohesion of matter]].<ref name=\"Arthur p. 56\"/>\n\nThe [[principle of sufficient reason]] has been invoked in recent [[cosmology]], and his [[identity of indiscernibles]] in quantum mechanics, a field some even credit him with having anticipated in some sense. Those who advocate [[digital philosophy]], a recent direction in cosmology, claim Leibniz as a precursor. In addition to his theories about the nature of reality, Leibniz's contributions to the development of calculus have also had a major impact on physics. \n\n====The ''vis viva''====\nLeibniz's ''[[vis viva]]'' (Latin for ''living force'') is ''mv''<sup>2</sup>, twice the modern [[kinetic energy]]. He realized that the total energy would be conserved in certain mechanical systems, so he considered it an innate motive characteristic of matter.<ref>See Ariew and Garber 155–86, Loemker §§53–55, W II.6–7a</ref> Here too his thinking gave rise to another regrettable nationalistic dispute. His ''vis viva'' was seen as rivaling the [[conservation of momentum]] championed by Newton in England and by [[Descartes]] in France; hence [[academics]] in those countries tended to neglect Leibniz's idea. In reality, both [[energy]] and [[momentum]] are conserved, so the two approaches are equally valid.\n\n===Other natural science===\nBy proposing that the earth has a molten core, he anticipated modern [[geology]]. In [[embryology]], he was a preformationist, but also proposed that organisms are the outcome of a combination of an infinite number of possible microstructures and of their powers. In the [[life sciences]] and [[paleontology]], he revealed an amazing transformist intuition, fueled by his study of comparative anatomy and fossils. One of his principal works on this subject, ''[[Protogaea]]'', unpublished in his lifetime, has recently been published in English for the first time. He worked out a primal [[organismic theory]].<ref>On Leibniz and biology, see Loemker (1969a: VIII).</ref> In medicine, he exhorted the physicians of his time—with some results—to ground their theories in detailed comparative observations and verified experiments, and to distinguish firmly scientific and metaphysical points of view.\n\n===Social science===\nMuch of Leibniz's work went on to have a great impact on the field of [[psychology]].<ref>On Leibniz and psychology, see Loemker (1969a: IX).</ref> His theory regarding [[consciousness]] in relation to the principle of continuity can be seen as an early theory regarding the stages of sleep. He believed that by the principle that phenomena found in nature were continuous by default, it was likely that the transition between conscious and [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] states had intermediary steps.<ref>Larry M. Jorgensen, [http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&type=summary&url=/journals/journal_of_the_history_of_philosophy/v047/47.2.jorgensen.html The Principle of Continuity and Leibniz's Theory of Consciousness]</ref> Though Leibniz's ideas regarding [[pre-established harmony]] were rejected by many, psychologists embraced his ideas of [[psychophysical parallelism]]. This idea refers to the [[mind–body problem]], stating that the mind and brain do not act upon each other, but act alongside each other separately but in harmony.<ref>D. Brett King, Wayne Viney and William Woody. ''A History of Psychology: Ideas and Context'' (2009), 150–153.</ref>\n\nLeibniz believed that the mind had a very active role in [[perception]], and plays a much larger role in sensory input. He focused heavily on perception, distinguishing between the type of perception where we are conscious of a stimulus, and the other which is being aware of a distinct perception. He thought that there are many ''petites perceptions'', or small perceptions of which we perceive but of which we are unaware. For example, when a bag of rice is spilled, we see the rice but are not necessarily aware of how many grains are in the pile. With this principle, there are an infinite number of perceptions within us at any given time of which we are unaware. For this to be true, there must also be a portion of the mind of which we are unaware at any given time. In this way, Leibniz's theory of perception can be viewed as one of many theories leading up to the idea of the unconscious.<ref>Nicholls and Leibscher, ''Thinking the Unconscious: Nineteenth-Century German Thought'' (2010), 6.</ref> Additionally, the idea of [[subliminal stimuli]] can be traced back to his theory of small perceptions.<ref>King ''et al''. (2009), 150–153.</ref> Leibniz was a direct influence on [[Ernst Platner]], who is credited with originally coining the term ''Unbewußtseyn'' (unconscious).<ref>Nicholls and Leibscher, ''Thinking the Unconscious: Nineteenth-Century German Thought'' (2010), 9.</ref>\n\nLeibniz's ideas regarding music and tonal perception went on to influence the laboratory studies of [[Wilhelm Wundt]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Klempe SH |title=The role of tone sensation and musical stimuli in early experimental psychology |journal=Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=187–99 |year=2011 |pmid=21462196 |doi=10.1002/jhbs.20495}}</ref>\n\nIn public health, he advocated establishing a medical administrative authority, with powers over [[epidemiology]] and [[veterinary medicine]]. He worked to set up a coherent medical training program, oriented towards public health and preventive measures. In economic policy, he proposed tax reforms and a national insurance program, and discussed the [[balance of trade]]. He even proposed something akin to what much later emerged as [[game theory]]. In [[sociology]] he laid the ground for [[communication theory]].\n\n===Technology===\nIn 1906, Garland published a volume of Leibniz's writings bearing on his many practical inventions and engineering work. To date, few of these writings have been translated into English. Nevertheless, it is well understood that Leibniz was a serious inventor, engineer, and applied scientist, with great respect for practical life. Following the motto ''theoria cum praxi'', he urged that theory be combined with practical application, and thus has been claimed as the father of [[applied science]]. He designed wind-driven propellers and water pumps, mining machines to extract ore, hydraulic presses, lamps, submarines, clocks, etc. With [[Denis Papin]], he invented a [[steam engine]]. He even proposed a method for desalinating water. From 1680 to 1685, he struggled to overcome the chronic flooding that afflicted the ducal [[silver]] mines in the [[Harz Mountains]], but did not succeed.<ref>Aiton (1985), 107–114, 136</ref>\n\n====Computation====\nLeibniz may have been the first computer scientist and information theorist.<ref>Davis (2000) discusses Leibniz's prophetic role in the emergence of calculating machines and of formal languages.</ref> Early in life, he documented the [[binary numeral system]] ([[radix|base]] 2), then revisited that system throughout his career.<ref>See Couturat (1901): 473–78.</ref> He anticipated [[Lagrange polynomial|Lagrangian interpolation]] and [[algorithmic information theory]]. His [[calculus ratiocinator]] anticipated aspects of the [[universal Turing machine]]. In 1961, [[Norbert Wiener]] suggested that Leibniz should be considered the patron saint of [[cybernetics]].<ref>Wiener, N., ''Cybernetics'' (2nd edition with revisions and two additional chapters), The MIT Press and Wiley, New York, 1961, p. 12.</ref>\n\nIn 1671, Leibniz began to invent a machine that could execute all four arithmetic operations, gradually improving it over a number of years. This \"[[stepped reckoner]]\" attracted fair attention and was the basis of his election to the [[Royal Society]] in 1673. A number of such machines were made during his years in [[Hanover]] by a craftsman working under his supervision. They were not an unambiguous success because they did not fully mechanize the [[Carry (arithmetic)|carry operation]]. Couturat reported finding an unpublished note by Leibniz, dated 1674, describing a machine capable of performing some algebraic operations.<ref>Couturat (1901), 115</ref> Leibniz also devised a (now reproduced) cipher machine, recovered by [[Nicholas Rescher]] in 2010.<ref>See N. Rescher, ''Leibniz and Cryptography'' (Pittsburgh, University Library Systems, University of Pittsburgh, 2012).</ref> In 1693, Leibniz released to the public a design of a machine which could, in theory, integrate differential equations.\n\nLeibniz was groping towards hardware and software concepts worked out much later by [[Charles Babbage]] and [[Ada Lovelace]]. In 1679, while mulling over his binary arithmetic, Leibniz imagined a machine in which binary numbers were represented by marbles, governed by a rudimentary sort of punched cards.<ref>[http://www.edge.org/discourse/schirrmacher_eurotech.html The Reality Club: Wake Up Call for Europe Tech<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Modern electronic digital computers replace Leibniz's marbles moving by gravity with shift registers, voltage gradients, and pulses of electrons, but otherwise they run roughly as Leibniz envisioned in 1679.\n\n===Librarian===\nWhile serving as librarian of the ducal libraries in [[Hanover]] and [[Wolfenbuettel]], Leibniz effectively became one of the founders of [[library science]]. The latter library was enormous for its day, as it contained more than 100,000 volumes, and Leibniz helped design a new building for it, believed to be the first building explicitly designed to be a library. He also designed a book [[library classification|indexing system]] in ignorance of the only other such system then extant, that of the [[Bodleian Library]] at [[Oxford University]]. He also called on publishers to distribute abstracts of all new titles they produced each year, in a standard form that would facilitate indexing. He hoped that this abstracting project would eventually include everything printed from his day back to [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]. Neither proposal met with success at the time, but something like them became standard practice among English language publishers during the 20th century, under the aegis of the [[Library of Congress]] and the [[British Library]].\n\nHe called for the creation of an [[empirical]] [[database]] as a way to further all sciences. His ''[[characteristica universalis]]'', [[calculus ratiocinator]], and a \"community of minds\"—intended, among other things, to bring political and religious unity to Europe—can be seen as distant unwitting anticipations of artificial languages (e.g., [[Esperanto]] and its rivals), [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]], even the [[World Wide Web]].\n\n===Advocate of scientific societies===\nLeibniz emphasized that [[research]] was a collaborative endeavor. Hence he warmly advocated the formation of national scientific societies along the lines of the [[Royal Society|British Royal Society]] and the French Academie Royale des Sciences. More specifically, in his correspondence and travels he urged the creation of such societies in Dresden, [[Saint Petersburg]], Vienna, and Berlin. Only one such project came to fruition; in 1700, the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy of Sciences]] was created. Leibniz drew up its first statutes, and served as its first President for the remainder of his life. That Academy evolved into the German Academy of Sciences, the publisher of the ongoing critical edition of his works.<ref>On Leibniz's projects for scientific societies, see Couturat (1901), App. IV.</ref>\n\n==Lawyer, moralist==\nWith the possible exception of [[Marcus Aurelius]], no philosopher has ever had as much experience with practical affairs of state as Leibniz. Leibniz's writings on law, ethics, and politics<ref>See, for example, Ariew and Garber 19, 94, 111, 193; Riley 1988; Loemker §§2, 7, 20, 29, 44, 59, 62, 65; W I.1, IV.1–3</ref> were long overlooked by English-speaking scholars, but this has changed of late.<ref>See (in order of difficulty) Jolley (2005: chpt. 7), Gregory Brown's chapter in Jolley (1995), Hostler (1975), and Riley (1996).</ref>\n\nWhile Leibniz was no apologist for [[absolute monarchy]] like [[Hobbes]], or for tyranny in any form, neither did he echo the political and constitutional views of his contemporary [[John Locke]], views invoked in support of democracy, in 18th-century America and later elsewhere. The following excerpt from a 1695 letter to Baron J. C. Boyneburg's son Philipp is very revealing of Leibniz's political sentiments:\n\n<blockquote>As for... the great question of the power of sovereigns and the obedience their peoples owe them, I usually say that it would be good for princes to be persuaded that their people have the right to resist them, and for the people, on the other hand, to be persuaded to obey them passively. I am, however, quite of the opinion of [[Grotius]], that one ought to obey as a rule, the evil of revolution being greater beyond comparison than the evils causing it. Yet I recognize that a prince can go to such excess, and place the well-being of the state in such danger, that the obligation to endure ceases. This is most rare, however, and the theologian who authorizes violence under this pretext should take care against excess; excess being infinitely more dangerous than deficiency.<ref>Loemker: 59, fn 16. Translation revised.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1677, Leibniz called for a European confederation, governed by a council or senate, whose members would represent entire nations and would be free to vote their consciences;<ref>Loemker: 58, fn 9</ref> this is sometimes considered an anticipation of the [[European Union]]. He believed that Europe would adopt a uniform religion. He reiterated these proposals in 1715.\n\nBut at the same time, he arrived to propose an interreligious and multicultural project to create a universal system of justice, which required from him a broad interdisciplinary perspective. In order to it, he combined linguistics, especially sinology, moral and law philosophy, management, economics, politics.<ref>See José Andrés-Gallego: 42. “Are Humanism and Mixed Methods Related? Leibniz’s Universal (Chinese) Dream”: Journal of Mixed Methods Research, 29(2) (2015): 118–132: http://mmr.sagepub.com/content/9/2/118.abstract.</ref>\n\n===Ecumenism===\nLeibniz devoted considerable intellectual and diplomatic effort to what would now be called [[ecumenism|ecumenical]] endeavor, seeking to reconcile first the [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Lutheran]] churches, later the Lutheran and [[Reformed]] churches. In this respect, he followed the example of his early patrons, Baron von Boyneburg and the Duke [[John Frederick, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg|John Frederick]]—both cradle Lutherans who converted to Catholicism as adults—who did what they could to encourage the reunion of the two faiths, and who warmly welcomed such endeavors by others. (The House of [[Brunswick-Lüneburg|Brunswick]] remained Lutheran because the Duke's children did not follow their father.) These efforts included corresponding with the French bishop [[Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet]], and involved Leibniz in some theological controversy. He evidently thought that the thoroughgoing application of reason would suffice to heal the breach caused by the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].\n\n==Philologist==\nLeibniz the [[philologist]] was an avid student of languages, eagerly latching on to any information about vocabulary and grammar that came his way. He refuted the belief, widely held by Christian scholars in his day, that [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] was the primeval language of the human race. He also refuted the argument, advanced by Swedish scholars in his day, that a form of proto-[[Swedish language|Swedish]] was the ancestor of the [[Germanic languages]]. He puzzled over the origins of the [[Slavic languages]], was aware of the existence of [[Sanskrit]], and was fascinated by [[classical Chinese]].\n\nHe published the ''princeps editio'' (first modern edition) of the [[Late Middle Ages|late medieval]] ''[[Chronicon Holtzatiae]]'', a Latin chronicle of the [[County of Holstein]].\n\n==Sinophile==\n[[File:Diagram of I Ching hexagrams owned by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, 1701.jpg|thumb|right|A diagram of ''[[I Ching]]'' hexagrams sent to Leibniz from [[Joachim Bouvet]]. The Arabic numerals were added by Leibniz.<ref>Perkins (2004), 117</ref>]]\nLeibniz was perhaps the first major European intellect to take a close interest in [[China|Chinese]] civilization, which he knew by corresponding with, and reading other works by, European Christian missionaries posted in China. Having read ''Confucius Sinarum Philosophus'' on the first year of its publication,<ref name=\"Mungello\">{{cite journal |last1=Mungello|first1=David E. |year= 1971|title=Leibniz's Interpretation of Neo-Confucianism|journal=Philosophy East and West|volume=21|issue=1|pages=3–22 |doi=10.2307/1397760}}</ref> he concluded that Europeans could learn much from the [[Confucianism|Confucian]] ethical tradition. He mulled over the possibility that the [[Chinese character]]s were an unwitting form of his [[Characteristica universalis|universal characteristic]]. He noted with fascination how the ''[[I Ching]]'' hexagrams correspond to the [[binary numbers]] from 000000 to 111111, and concluded that this mapping was evidence of major Chinese accomplishments in the sort of philosophical mathematics he admired.<ref>On Leibniz, the ''I Ching'', and binary numbers, see Aiton (1985: 245–48). Leibniz's writings on Chinese civilization are collected and translated in Cook and Rosemont (1994), and discussed in Perkins (2004).</ref>\n\nLeibniz's attraction to [[Chinese philosophy]] originates from his perception that Chinese philosophy was similar to his own.<ref name=\"Mungello\"/> The historian E.R. Hughes suggests that Leibniz's ideas of \"simple substance\" and \"pre-established harmony\" were directly influenced by [[Confucianism]], pointing to the fact that they were conceived during the period that he was reading ''Confucius Sinarum Philosophus''.<ref name=\"Mungello\"/>\n\n== As polymath ==\nWhile making his grand tour of European archives to research the Brunswick family history that he never completed, Leibniz stopped in [[Vienna]] between May 1688 and February 1689, where he did much legal and diplomatic work for the Brunswicks. He visited mines, talked with mine engineers, and tried to negotiate export contracts for lead from the ducal mines in the [[Harz mountains]]. His proposal that the streets of Vienna be lit with lamps burning [[rapeseed oil]] was implemented. During a formal audience with the [[Holy Roman Emperor|Austrian Emperor]] and in subsequent memoranda, he advocated reorganizing the Austrian economy, reforming the coinage of much of central Europe, negotiating a [[Concordat]] between the [[Habsburg]]s and the [[Holy See|Vatican]], and creating an imperial research library, official archive, and public insurance fund. He wrote and published an important paper on [[mechanics]].\n\nLeibniz also wrote a short paper, ''Primae veritates'', first published by [[Louis Couturat]] in 1903 (pp.&nbsp;518–523)<ref>Later translated as Loemker 267 and Woolhouse and Francks 30</ref> summarizing his views on [[metaphysics]]. The paper is undated; that he wrote it while in Vienna in 1689 was determined only in 1999, when the ongoing critical edition finally published Leibniz's philosophical writings for the period 1677–90.<ref>A VI, 4, n. 324, pp. 1643–1649 with the title: ''Principia Logico-Metaphysica''</ref> Couturat's reading of this paper was the launching point for much 20th-century thinking about Leibniz, especially among [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosophers]]. But after a meticulous study of all of Leibniz's philosophical writings up to 1688—a study the 1999 additions to the critical edition made possible—Mercer (2001) begged to differ with Couturat's reading; the jury is still out.\n\n==Posthumous reputation==\n\n=== As a mathematician and philosopher ===\nWhen Leibniz died, his reputation was in decline. He was remembered for only one book, the ''[[Théodicée]]'',<ref>{{see also |Irenaean theodicy#Gottfried Leibniz}}</ref> whose supposed central argument [[Voltaire]] lampooned in his popular book ''[[Candide]]'', which concludes with the character Candide saying, \"''[[Non liquet]]''\" (it is not clear), a term that was applied during the Roman Republic to a legal verdict of \"not proven\". Voltaire's depiction of Leibniz's ideas was so influential that many believed it to be an accurate description. Thus Voltaire and his ''Candide'' bear some of the blame for the lingering failure to appreciate and understand Leibniz's ideas. Leibniz had an ardent disciple, [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]], whose dogmatic and facile outlook did Leibniz's reputation much harm. He also influenced [[David Hume]] who read his ''[[Théodicée]]'' and used some of his ideas.<ref>[http://www.humesociety.org/hs/issues/v19n1/vasilyeu/vasilyeu-v19n1.pdf Vasilyev, 1993]</ref> In any event, philosophical fashion was moving away from the rationalism and system building of the 17th century, of which Leibniz had been such an ardent proponent. His work on law, diplomacy, and history was seen as of ephemeral interest. The vastness and richness of his correspondence went unrecognized.\n\nMuch of Europe came to doubt that Leibniz had discovered calculus independently of Newton, and hence his whole work in mathematics and physics was neglected. Voltaire, an admirer of Newton, also wrote ''Candide'' at least in part to discredit Leibniz's claim to having discovered calculus and Leibniz's charge that [[Newton's theory of universal gravitation]] was incorrect.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nLeibniz's long march to his present glory began with the 1765 publication of the ''Nouveaux Essais'', which [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] read closely. In 1768, [[Louis Dutens]] edited the first multi-volume edition of Leibniz's writings, followed in the 19th century by a number of editions, including those edited by Erdmann, Foucher de Careil, Gerhardt, Gerland, Klopp, and Mollat. Publication of Leibniz's correspondence with notables such as [[Antoine Arnauld]], [[Samuel Clarke]], [[Sophia of Hanover]], and her daughter [[Sophia Charlotte of Hanover]], began.\n\nIn 1900, [[Bertrand Russell]] published a critical study of Leibniz's [[metaphysics]].<ref>Russell, 1900</ref> Shortly thereafter, [[Louis Couturat]] published an important study of Leibniz, and edited a volume of Leibniz's heretofore unpublished writings, mainly on logic. They made Leibniz somewhat respectable among 20th-century [[analytic philosophy|analytical]] and [[linguistic philosophy|linguistic]] philosophers in the English-speaking world (Leibniz had already been of great influence to many Germans such as [[Bernhard Riemann]]). For example, Leibniz's phrase ''[[salva veritate]]'', meaning interchangeability without loss of or compromising the truth, recurs in [[Willard Quine]]'s writings. Nevertheless, the secondary literature on Leibniz did not really blossom until after World War II. This is especially true of English speaking countries; in Gregory Brown's bibliography fewer than 30 of the English language entries were published before 1946. American Leibniz studies owe much to [[Leroy Loemker]] (1904–1985) through his translations and his interpretive essays in LeClerc (1973).\n\n[[Nicholas Jolley]] has surmised that Leibniz's reputation as a philosopher is now perhaps higher than at any time since he was alive.<ref>Jolley, 217–19</ref> Analytic and contemporary philosophy continue to invoke his notions of [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]], [[Principle of individuation|individuation]], and [[possible worlds]]. Work in the history of 17th- and 18th-century [[history of ideas|ideas]] has revealed more clearly the 17th-century \"Intellectual Revolution\" that preceded the better-known [[industrial revolution|Industrial]] and commercial revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nIn 1985, the German government created the [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize|Leibniz Prize]], offering an annual award of 1.55 million [[euro]]s for experimental results and 770,000 euros for theoretical ones. It was the worlds largest prize for scientific achievement prior to the [[Fundamental Physics Prize]].\n\nThe collection of manuscript papers of Leibniz at the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Bibliothek – Niedersächische Landesbibliothek were inscribed on [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World Register]] in 2007.<ref name=mow>{{cite web|title= Letters from and to Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz within the collection of manuscript papers of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz |url= http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=22464&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html | date=2008-05-16 |publisher=UNESCO Memory of the World Programme |accessdate=2009-12-15}}</ref>\n\n==Writings and edition==\nLeibniz mainly wrote in three languages: scholastic [[Latin]], [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]]. During his lifetime, he published many pamphlets and scholarly articles, but only two \"philosophical\" books, the ''Combinatorial Art'' and the ''[[Théodicée]]''. (He published numerous pamphlets, often anonymous, on behalf of the House of [[Brunswick-Lüneburg]], most notably the \"De jure suprematum\" a major consideration of the nature of [[sovereignty]].) One substantial book appeared posthumously, his ''[[Nouveaux essais sur l'entendement humain]]'', which Leibniz had withheld from publication after the death of [[John Locke]]. Only in 1895, when Bodemann completed his catalogue of Leibniz's manuscripts and correspondence, did the enormous extent of Leibniz's ''[[Nachlass]]'' become clear: about 15,000 letters to more than 1000 recipients plus more than 40,000 other items. Moreover, quite a few of these letters are of essay length. Much of his vast correspondence, especially the letters dated after 1700, remains unpublished, and much of what is published has been so only in recent decades. The amount, variety, and disorder of Leibniz's writings are a predictable result of a situation he described in a letter as follows:\n\n<blockquote>I cannot tell you how extraordinarily distracted and spread out I am. I am trying to find various things in the archives; I look at old papers and hunt up unpublished documents. From these I hope to shed some light on the history of the [House of] Brunswick. I receive and answer a huge number of letters. At the same time, I have so many mathematical results, philosophical thoughts, and other literary innovations that should not be allowed to vanish that I often do not know where to begin.<ref>Letter to [[Vincent Placcius]], 15 September 1695, in [[Louis Dutens]] (ed.), ''Gothofridi Guillemi Leibnitii Opera Omnia'', vol. 6.1, 1768, pp. 59–60.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe extant parts of the critical edition<ref name=\"ce\">[http://www.leibniz-edition.de/ www.leibniz-edition.de]. See photograph there.</ref> of Leibniz's writings are organized as follows:\n* Series 1. ''Political, Historical, and General Correspondence''. 25 vols., 1666–1706.\n* Series 2. ''Philosophical Correspondence''. 3 vols., 1663–1700.\n* Series 3. ''Mathematical, Scientific, and Technical Correspondence''. 8 vols., 1672–1698.\n* Series 4. ''Political Writings''. 7 vols., 1667–99.\n* Series 5. ''Historical and Linguistic Writings''. Inactive.\n* Series 6.

''Scientific, Medical, and Technical Writings''. 1 vol., 1668–76.\n\nThe systematic cataloguing of all of Leibniz's ''Nachlass'' began in 1901. It was hampered by two world wars and decades of German division in two states with the cold war's \"iron curtain\" in between, separating scholars, and also scattering portions of his literary estates. The ambitious project has had to deal with seven languages contained in some 200,000 pages of written and printed paper. In 1985 it was reorganized and included in a joint program of German federal and state (''Länder'') academies. Since then the branches in [[Potsdam]], [[Münster]], [[Hanover]] and [[Berlin]] have jointly published 57 volumes of the critical edition, with an average of 870 pages, and prepared index and [[Concordance (publishing)|concordance]] works.\n\n=== Selected works ===\nThe year given is usually that in which the work was completed, not of its eventual publication.\n* 1666 (publ. 1690).
