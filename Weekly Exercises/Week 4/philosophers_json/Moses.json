However, since Moses remained a long time on the mountain, some of the people feared that he might be dead, so they made a statue of a [[golden calf]] and [[Sacred bull|worshiped it]], thus disobeying and angering God and Moses. Moses, out of anger, broke the tablets, and later ordered the elimination of those who had worshiped the golden statue, which was melted down and fed to the [[Idolatry|idolaters]]. He also wrote the ten commandments on a new set of tablets. Later at Mount Sinai, Moses and the elders entered into a covenant, by which Israel would become the people of YHWH, obeying his laws, and YHWH would be their god. Moses delivered the laws of God to Israel, instituted [[Kohen|the priesthood]] under the sons of Moses' brother [[Aaron]], and destroyed those Israelites who fell away from his worship. In his final act at Sinai, God gave Moses instructions for the [[Tabernacle]], the mobile shrine by which he would travel with Israel to the Promised Land. {{citation needed|reason=What is the primary source for this?|date=June 2016}}\n\nFrom Sinai, Moses led the Israelites to the [[Desert of Paran]] on the border of Canaan. From there he sent [[The Twelve Spies|twelve spies]] into the land. The spies returned with samples of the land's fertility, but warned that its inhabitants were [[Giant (mythology)#Abrahamic mythology|giants]].  The people were afraid and wanted to return to Egypt, and some rebelled against Moses and against God.  Moses told the Israelites that they were not worthy to inherit the land, and would wander the wilderness for forty years until the generation who had refused to enter Canaan had died, so that it would be their children who would possess the land.{{citation needed|reason=What is the primary source for this?|date=June 2016}}\n\nWhen the forty years had passed, Moses led the Israelites east around the [[Dead Sea]] to the territories of [[Edom]] and [[Moab]].  There they escaped the temptation of idolatry, received God's blessing through [[Balaam]] the prophet, and massacred the [[Midian]]ites, who by the end of the Exodus journey had become the enemies of the Israelites. Moses was twice given notice that he would die before entry to the Promised Land: in [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 27:13, once he had seen the Promised Land from a viewpoint on [[Abarim|Mount Abarim]], and again in Numbers 31:1 once battle with the Midianites had been won.{{citation needed|reason=What is the primary source for this?|date=June 2016}}\n\nOn the banks of the [[Jordan River]], in sight of the land, Moses assembled the [[Tribes of Israel#The Twelve Tribes|tribes]].

He writes, for example, that Moses opposed the picturing of the deity in the form of man or animal, and was convinced that the deity was an entity which encompassed everything – land and sea:{{Sfn | Shmuel | 1976 | p = 1132}}\n{{blockquote|\n35.

For God [said he] may be this one thing which encompasses us all, land and sea, which we call heaven, or the universe, or the nature of things....\n\n36.

His primary work, wherein he describes [[Jewish philosophy]], is his ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Histories]]'' (c. 100), where, according to Arthur Murphy, as a result of the Jewish worship of one God, \"[[paganism|pagan]] mythology fell into contempt.\"<ref>Tacitus, Cornelius.

In addition, he \"stresses Moses' willingness to undergo toil and his careful avoidance of bribery. Like [[Plato]]'s [[Philosopher king|philosopher-king]], Moses excels as an educator.\"{{Sfn | Feldman | 1998 | p = 130}}\n\n===In Numenius===\n[[Numenius of Apamea|Numenius]], a Greek philosopher who was a native of [[Apamea, Syria|Apamea]], in Syria, wrote during the latter half of the 2nd century CE.

Moses is also given a number of bynames in Jewish tradition.

[[Artapanus of Alexandria]] explicitly identified Moses not only with Thoth/[[Hermes]], but also with the Greek figure [[Musaeus of Athens|Musaeus]] (whom he called \"the teacher of [[Orpheus]]\"), and ascribed to him the division of Egypt into 36 districts, each with its own liturgy. He named the princess who adopted Moses as Merris, wife of Pharaoh Chenephres.<ref>Eusebius, l.c. ix. 27</ref>\n\nAncient sources mention an Assumption of Moses and a Testimony of Moses. A Latin text was found in [[Milan]] in the 19th century by [[Antonio Ceriani]] who called it the [[Assumption of Moses]], even though it does not refer to an assumption of Moses or contain portions of the Assumption which are cited by ancient authors, and it is apparently actually the Testimony.

New Testament writers {{Who|{{June 2016}}|date=June 2016}} often compared Jesus' words and deeds with Moses' to explain Jesus' mission. In [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 7:39–43, 51–53, for example, the rejection of Moses by the Jews who worshiped the [[golden calf]] is likened to the rejection of Jesus by the Jews that continued in traditional Judaism. {{citation needed|reason=Secondary sources needed for this material|date=June 2016}}\n\nMoses also figures in several of Jesus' messages. When he met the [[Pharisees|Pharisee]] [[Nicodemus]] at night in the third chapter of the [[Gospel of John]], he compared Moses' lifting up of the [[Nehushtan|bronze serpent]] in the wilderness, which any Israelite could look at and be healed, to his own lifting up (by his death and [[resurrection]]) for the people to look at and be healed. In the sixth chapter, Jesus responded to the people's claim that Moses provided them ''[[manna]]'' in the wilderness by saying that it was not Moses, but God, who provided. Calling himself the \"[[Bread of Life Discourse|bread of life]]\", Jesus stated that He was provided to feed God's people. {{citation needed|reason=Secondary sources needed for this material|date=June 2016}}\n\nMoses, along with [[Elijah]], is presented as meeting with Jesus in all three Gospel accounts of the [[Transfiguration of Jesus]] in [[Matthew 17]], [[Mark 9]], and [[Luke 9]], respectively. Later Christians {{Who|{{June 2016}}|date=June 2016}} found numerous other parallels between the life of Moses and Jesus to the extent that Jesus was likened {{By whom|date=June 2016}} to a \"second Moses.\" For instance, Jesus' escape from the [[Massacre of the Innocents|slaughter by Herod in Bethlehem]] is compared {{By whom|date=June 2016}} to Moses' escape from Pharaoh's designs to kill Hebrew infants.
